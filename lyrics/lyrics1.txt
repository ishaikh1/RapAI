Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! I can feel your energy from two planets away. I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I 'm yelling. Bitch, don't kill my vibe!  Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!  Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist. I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous. I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is. How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you? Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart. Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick. I can admit that it did look like yours. Why you resent every making of this? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge. I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous. You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin' To you that's a quick check. With all disrespect, let me say thisI

You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does. And I 'm lookin' right past you. We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior. This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to. To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
I s way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name

Let it run, Ali. Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit yo' bitch-ass down
And listen to this true mothafuckin' story
Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bish.
Smokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ay-ay-ay-ah
Really I 'm a sober soul
But I 'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah
Really I 'm a peacemaker
But I 'm with the homies right now
And Momma used to say
One day it's gon' burn you out
One day it's gon' burn you out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out
One day it's gon' burn you
But I 'm with the homies right now
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble. I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
I f it’s necessary;bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent. The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world;we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I ’m drug-free, but shit, I ’m with the homies
Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga! Me and the homies. Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more. Me and the homies. I ride for my mothafuckin’ niggas. Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in. Me and the homies. Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like, “Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo! … Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo! ”I t’s 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I ’ll tell you to suck my dick, then I 'll continue eatin'We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses. Good Lord, they knew we weren’t from ‘round there
‘Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SI M cards. Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination. Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn’t like
Then started interrogatin'I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That’s ironic,'cause I ’ve never been violent
Until I ’m with the homies
Me and the homies
. Me and the homies
. Me and the homies
Braggin' about the episode we just had. A shot of Hennessey didn’t make me feel that bad. I ’m usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya. We tryna conquer the city with disobedience. Quick to turn it up, even if we ain’t got the CD in. But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still “nigga, what is you sayin'? ”Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want
Aye, aye, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe! 
Aye, nigga, I think it's somebody in this room! 
Wait, what? ! 
Nigga, it's somebody in this room! I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk. We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life. My mama called: . Hello? What you doin'?  — . Kickin' it.
I shoulda told her I ’m probably ‘bout to catch my first offense
With the homies. But – they made a right, they made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies. K. Dot, you faded, hood? 
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one? 
Well, which one he talkin' about? 
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans! What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga? 
. Last time I checked I was the man on these streets! 
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
I 'm tryna be the nigga in the street. There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan, luv
We gon' use the kickback as a alibi, wait'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight. That's what he’s not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
I 'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
Nigga, sit yo' dumb-ass back down! 
Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight! 
Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!

My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die broke. Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I 'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no. People tryna say I 'm goin' crazy on Twitter. My friends' best advice was to stay low. I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll. The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control. I just feel like I 'm the only one not pretendin'I 'm not out of control, I 'm just not in they control. I know I 'm the most influential
That TI ME cover was just confirmation. This generation's closest thing to Einstein. So don't worry about me, I 'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like. Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive. Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions. Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different

I f the phone ringin', go and get your kids ho. Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled. Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime. The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime. Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin''bout how my neck look? . Well... it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains. The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard. Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality. Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary? I am one with the people
I am one with the people I 've been woken from enlightened man's dream. Checkin' I nstagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem. Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if I 'm up way too much, I 'm out of touch. I 'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen. So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort. I know, I know he got a plan, I know I 'm on your beams
One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me. When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see. I would've took a hundred million and gave 20 to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove. But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then I 'ma never go broke. Only thing I ask is next time I 'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo. She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped'em at Aldo. Modern day MJ with a off the wall flow.
My life, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I 'm deliverin' everything I 've ever sent to you, bring. Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas.
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi. Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
. Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife.
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I 'm invisible
Now I 'm visible to you
Oh the invisible truths they sold
I can't quite understand the games you play. Understand, understand
Understand I 'm standin' under oath
And I promised I , I wouldn't fall anymore
But I 'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here
And stood by me
And look at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above.
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky.
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife

So why send oppression not blessings? 
Why, oh why'd you do me wrong? 
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong
 Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light
 To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey,'cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light
When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck'til it drifted Pangaea

This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'ma still give them raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh,'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light

Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feels like they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said

Real friends, how many of us? 
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
I's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion

Real friends

Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions'bout some real shit?

Cause everybody got'em, that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
I's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be
Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends,'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off,'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends? 
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many? 
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, 
What's up, fam? Hope you good
You say, 
I'm good, I'm great,  the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many? 
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh? 
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him
Lost out, beat up
Dancin', down there
I found you, somewhere out
'Round'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Right down there, right'round there
Lost and, found out
Turned out, how you thought
Daddy, found out
How you turned out, how you turned out
If mama knew now
How you turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, I need you now
Love you, got to
Love you, love you
Found you, found you
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
If your mama knew how
You turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, and I need you now
Lost in... my doubt
Cry, I'm not sorry
Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessy? 
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you
I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh, unseasoned
You found me, in your gaze
I found you, oh Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
And I need you now
Lost and found out
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impregnate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband? 
Then I said, 
What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph around hella thugs? 
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves
 
What if Mary
 was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love? 
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
 We surrounded by
 the fuckin' wolves​​​

Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, Amen
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an'04 Mercedes-Benz
Hello, my name is Kendrick,  she said 
No, you're handsome.
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now
Cool, where you stay? 
She said: 
Down the street from Dominguez High
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
Well, is it Compton?  – 
No,  she replied
And quickly start battin' her eyes
And strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen, with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful
What you tryin' to get into? 
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and well
The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who could imagine? Maybe my actions will end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck,'cause the trife in us
I's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted; in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible
Family history of gang bangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
I wanna come over, what's up? 
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm tryin' to get off
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of bein' thirsty
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it, I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' about that sex, thinkin' about her thighs
Or maybe kissin' on her neck, or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties blowin' up my texts
I looked at'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem
I'm two blocks away, 250 feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang
Please leave your message for 323-
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick, where you at? 
Damn! I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fiffteen minutes!

These kids ready to eat! I’m ready to eat, shit
I gotta get them food stamps, come on now
You on you way or what? 
I hope you ain’t out there messin' with them damn hood-rats out there, shit, especially that crazy-ass girl Sherane
Plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain’t gon' pass to the next grade, 11th grade
Yo' daddy hollerin' about some damn dominoes
He want to holler at you too
Go'head, Kenny, go! Shit
Kenny!  You on his voicemail! Damn fool  Shit! 
Kenny, give me the damn phone, shit. Don’t hang up! Damn! 
Just let me— Kendrick

Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment! Fuck! 
Fuck them damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that

Me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish
Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit' it, ya bish?
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You lookin' like a easy come-up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 after school
You know, “Big Ballin' With My Homies”
Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish
Another casualty of war, ya bish
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish
That Louis Burger never be the same
A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin'
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin'
Gang signs out the window, ya bish
Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin'
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs
But it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Foot
Locker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel
K’s Mom: Kendrick, just bring my car back, man. I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren’t gonna be back here on time anyways. Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house, man. This man, on one, he feelin' good as a motherfucker. Shit, I’m tryna get my thing goin', too. Just bring my car back. Shit, he faded. He feelin' good. Look, listen to him!
K’s Dad: Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol’ fat ass. Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol’ fat ass.
K’s Mom: See, he high as hell. Shit, and he ain’t even trippin' off them damn dominoes anymore. Just bring the car back!
K’s Dad: Did somebody say dominoes?
Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S.
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S.
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S.
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
"I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem."
"Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?"
"Yo, I don't care who this nigga over here for.
If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry."
"Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay?
I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?
You gon' tell me where you from, okay?
Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?"
"Enough with all this talkin'."
"Matter of fact, get out the van, homie! Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie!"
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby
Look inside these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir: "What do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?"
As the record spin I should pray
For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin'
Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walkin' from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind 'cause one day you'll respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d city
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby
All I see is strobe lights, blindin' me in my hindsight
Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere
As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
And you ask: "Lift up your shirt," because you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard 'em chatter: "He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest
He don't mind, he know we'll never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city."
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby
All I see in this room: 20's, Xannies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane
Society? It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothin' to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby
Pour up , head shot 
Sit down , stand up 
Pass out , wake up 
Faded , faded 
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up , head shot 
Sit down , stand up 
Pass out , wake up 
Faded , faded 
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience
If you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up , head shot 
Sit down , stand up 
Pass out , wake up 
Faded , faded 
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock

Aw man… where is she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me?
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ----'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
{Car door opens and gunshots are fired}
Aha! Got them niggas, K-dot, you good?
L----, you good?
Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?
These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!Part I — "Sing About Me"
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright, and a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands, my plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride, it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering "Get 'em"
I got 'em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— {gunshots}
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby"
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck, and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in? I'll wait…
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit!
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passing away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
’Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wondering when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "It need to be told"
Cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady being distracted by money, drugs, and four-fives
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you
Sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
"Ay, ay, ay, Where you 'bout to go?"
"Nigga, the homie's brother-- nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!"
"Nigga-- they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga."
"Al- alright, nigga-- nigga just come-- alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back."
{Hangs up}
"Arghh... Fuck!
So what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?"
"Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now"
"Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!"Part II — "I'm Dying of Thirst"
Tired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind, but retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst?
Dope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mourning her
Stray bullets
AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst
How many sins? I'm running out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power 
Yours is ours 
Lay with a snitch
Die with a coward
Hope we get rich
Hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst
What are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot
Fire is proven
To burn for eternity
Return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous, but how to shoot it
Tired of running
Choirs is humming
Tell us to visit
We lie about coming
Now back to business
Loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feuding
The beef is bubbling
It's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst
Too many sins, I'm running out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
My best days, I stress days
Say "Fuck the world", my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed – What's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running, tired of tumbling
Tired of running, tired of tumbling – backwards
My momma say "See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst, you dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"
Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
"Lord God, I come to You a sinner."
"And I humbly repent for my sins."
"I believe that Jesus is Lord."
"I believe you raised Him from the dead."
"I would ask that Jesus come into my life."
"And to be my Lord and Savior."
"I receive Jesus to take control of my life."
"And that I may live with Him from this day forward."
"Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood."
"In Jesus name, amen."
Alright now, remember this day
The start of a new life – your REAL life
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!
"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know! Where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, Hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, "Ayy, y'all, duck!"
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d city
"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know! Where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!
Wake yo' punk-ass up!
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
Hood 
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. "Compton's Human Sacrifice"
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what!
M.A.A.d city
Compton
Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn!
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?
Niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up!
Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?
Don't even trip
Just lay back and drink that
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill
You're living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold that say "Queen"
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love French tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, 
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin' control
Of everything that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love running, ducking police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real 
The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free
And plan C just an excuse like "because"
Or the word "but," but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse ’cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse ’cause you're the homie that pack
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love?
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
Should I hate them for telling me "ball out"?
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hating all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?
Kenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore. Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did, homie. Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. Real is God, nigga
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real 
Alright, that's all I wanted to tell you. Just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom
Boy, you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't trippin'. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by Food for Less and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take that music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago, you know that's what we do

Sing my song, it's all for you
"If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? Talk to you later, bye."
Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
Ay, Dre what's happening wit' it my nigga
Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats
Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the East side
Know that's just how Compton roll
And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA
America target our rap market, as controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich
And the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers
That know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
"Look who's responsible
For taking Compton international
I make 'em holla"
Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie
Just Blaze
Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine
Mom, I finna use the van real quick!
Be back, 15 minutes!
*sound of airplane wheels hitting the tarmac*
Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you taught me to
Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you taught me to
Every morning when I wake up, uh
Money on my mind, good time to get caked up, uh
Sunshine coming through my blinds, I’m living, but
Really though, it's never enough
10 milli on, that's a must, living in California
Everybody wanna visit for women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive, down the block and
You look outside, H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day, I guess, for a bitch to roll with Andre, I guess
Roll it up, baby, come and lift that dress then roll it up for me when I'm stressed
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi Town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever, come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to LA
Uhh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some
Three W's only for a three-day run, bitch
Take them mothafuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio 'cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
'Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know I'm priority, order me
Hennessey and for my niggas
OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Boy he's on his job, boy, he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
No way, hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be on to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
That it's eighty-two degrees and my top peeled off
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi Town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever, come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to LA
Known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, mothafuck your opinion
Huh, how many ways am I killing 'em? Shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean she'll fuck 'til the morning, time and I got time
And I know that I'm in a position of controlling anything, I by that ocean
I'm a boss, I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this
They want that shit, they often fiend
I give it to 'em, but in between
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings
Life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean
Toward three W's in life
You know blow job need an application
Eating pussy make appetite
And yeah my type, I like 'em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think?
I don't fuck with no hand me downs
See if you fuck then it's after me
You know how much I'mma make it work?
You know her dress, slip it in her purse
When you discussed your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first, Cali
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi Town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever, come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to LA
Some saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
Some saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
Some saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it"
Frustrated and I'm riding down the back streets
Making my conscience ask me
"Would I survive to make it up out this hole in time?"
Black boy fly, black boy fly
Black, black boy fly, black boy fly
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym, we was living in sorrow
Total envy of him, he made his dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way up outta Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes, heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal, meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
Eleven graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA, we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy...
I used to be jealous of Jayceon
I used to be jealous of Jayceon Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
It's 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game, they line in front of the store
Swap meets, selling our mixtapes, I'm like, "Oh shit, wait"
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion, I was defending my insecurities
Chillin' my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy...
My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said, but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
Award touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like Top 40
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner, had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
That only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces, you just a typical homy
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all'll buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle?
When two niggas making it out had never sounded logical?
Three niggas making it out? That's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
I wasn't jealous cause of the talents they got
I was terrified they'd be the last black boys to fly out of Compton
Thank God...
We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!
Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name in unison, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here
Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
They believe in me
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted
To the earth cause the people that hurt can understand it
You speakin' outlandish
I'mma show you how to make it all work
Another planet, a short term goal for me
A record sold for me
It's just more of me in your ear
For you to hear Kendrick persevere
Defenses I feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin' off I ain't takin off these Pistons
I'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance
Came across me, how much it'a cost me
To get you out my business
I said a planet is a short term goal, no sky is the limit
I'm past that, now pass that
Award, not one but four
Times two plus yours
I see myself performing there, 
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammy's winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Traveling around the world with endorsement deals
Can't imagine how it feels
That's why I'm smiling everyday
Because my dream ain't far away
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
You looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed
Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath
Breathe in lungs of a victory and vividly
You see me when at my best, my worst
This verse dedicated to the days that I slept
With a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and crown
I'm a King on the prowl and I see mama smile?
And I vow on the tape that I'll never break
You can break bread with me now
We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
And walked that mile
In the darkness I often sit back
And get lost in the rap that I wrote
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talking to you
I was walking it through every ghetto
Tell success hello
We here
And I'm so happy I cry
Cause I can't believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it's so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And you've come so far
And you know that it's the time for you to lift your bar
And I'm gonna do it
Watch me!
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth
Momma take this mothafuckin' block off
Tryna reach you everyday, collect calls
Never get through, and I go through withdrawals
Say who told you that I wanted this door
To slam shut, I just wanted to vent or
Ask you if you give me your rent for
A attorney, I can pay you back more
Soon as I get out, yea every rack is yours
Commissary running low, I need help
Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself
K Dot wrote me saying Marcus got killed
If you knew me, then you know how bad I feel
Quisha prove me wrong, and never came to visit
And I heard she fucking on some other nigga
And my niggas left me in the dark, blind
Mama just get back at me this last time
Men lie, women lie – men lie, women lie
Men lie, women lie – men lie, women lie
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth
Mama take this mothafuckin' block off
That's on the date the day I take the block off
Pulled up, and they put me in them cop cars
Please believe me, This ain't easy by far
You forgot you're talking to your only son
Remember when you put me in that relay run
I was racing, chasing dreams to be the best
You had taught me that the very day I won
All I need is you to give me same support
Investigation saying that the same report
From a witness just might testify in court
DA say I take a deal, or take a loss
I ain't built for all them god damn numbers
God's will, say a prayer for me mama
If you can't, then open up the phone lines
Mama just get back at me this last time
Dante, if I stress to take the block off
That's the day the state had take them locks off
I could only help but do so much
Bettering yourself, your own crutch
Look at your reflection tell me who you see
Who is your protection, G-O-D
No it's not neglection, I have just accepted
Your fate and what its gon' be
Remember all the nights that I cried
Thinking that my only son just died
Peeking through the window, kicking through the door
It's you they looking for, raid outside
Rather see you locked up than dead
Only you would say that I'm selfish
So before I take the stand, and put this bible in my hand
Son, let me say this
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth
Momma take this mothafuckin' block off

Son, let me say this
Greeting boys and girls
My name is Petey P
Kendrick's childhood imaginary friend 
I am your neighbor
And I’d like to welcome you to good kid, m.A.A.d city
So grab your cartoons and cereal
Your pop guns and fireworks
And sing along
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
I’ve been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burgerstand at '95
People staring at 'em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
We was living out a hotel at the time
Breakfast, lunch and dinner chicken from Kentucky Fried
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers the move
When nothing else to lose but a burger flipping job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine it's a mansion
Gold ballroom, AK-47 dancing
Howling at the moon, what’s a pack of hungry babies?
Hope you feed us soon, bite your back, you die of rabies
Everyday we pray to eat at the table at Sizzlers
But never make the visit, if better days was on its way
Then they make the decision, to make the wrong turn
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
And all the ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car”
All the ghetto boys say, “that’s my car”
All the ghetto girls say, “that’s my car”
When we grow up, when we grow up
Ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car”
All the ghetto boys say, “that’s my car”
All the ghetto girls say, “that’s my car”
When we grow up, when we grow up
Couple stolen T.V.'s and a seat belt for my safety
Played the passenger I think it’s five years after eighty
Seven, do the math, ‘92, don’t you be lazy
Looking out the window, notice all the essentials
Of a block party that stop for a second, then it rekindle
Like a flame from a trick candle, everybody got dental
Insurance ‘cause we ‘bout to floss, you get that couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials
Of a scholar but, shit, not today, them Dayton Spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi,  I want them Kenwood woofers
Say that you got me, if not, I’ll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bulls' eye like Tauruses
Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
"Papa, you really telling me we can just get some more of it
If we run out?" He said, "Lil' nigga, today the poor is rich
Don’t tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb
If she ask just know you have to lie and son don’t forget
Bitches ain’t shit, hoes ain’t neither
Niggas gon' snitch, watch the company you keeping
And one day you’ll put money in the ghetto when you got it
Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots"
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane

Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Even better than I was the last time baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, I'm good

Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song, and I'mma make another
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors
Ben-a-Baller, Benford, butlers, chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds zan, gallon lean
Make a joke 'bout Leno's hair then piggy back on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain, I got some motherfucking bitches
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job

Twerk, twerk, merge, swerve, dang, pick a lane
Flip a bird; pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame
But God I'm good, swear I couldn’t be better
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some "x" on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexing my lungs
See them showing they teeth, that's just them flapping they gums
If they bite and I'm snapping, clap clap collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancelor The Rapper, please say "The Rapper"
Magical word , please say 'Kadabra
Replay the replays; Green Bay, the Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk 'til dawn
It's just us, and trust ya bottom, bitch, my stuff the fucking bomb
I'm the motherfucking fucker, fuck a niggas fucking dumb
This your favorite fucking album, I ain't even fucking done

See them showing they teeth, that's just them flapping they gums
If they bite and I'm snapping, clap clap collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancelor The Rapper, please say "The Rapper"
Magical word , please say 'Kadabra
Replay the replays; Green Bay, the Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk 'til dawn
It's just us, and trust ya bottom, bitch, my stuff the fucking bomb

Damn, I'm in so deep, girl
Probably 'cause you're empty
You can't even speak 
Damn, your mouth so minty
Ooh your mama hate me
Daddy wouldn't let you, if he ever met me
If he ever met you
Put that shit behind us
And put this in your sinus
Mine is all up in my gums
Minus all that shit it's lined with
I say oh oh oh ohh
You been scratchin', you been fiendin'
I'mma fix you, I'mma fuck you
I'mma get rid of them demons
It's my
My druggy
When I'm ugly
Hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy
I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost
Damn, I need a minute... aight, lehgo
She fell in love, it fell apart... aight, let go
She met her match, I let her match
She lit her match, she let me smoke
Yeah me mad petty, yeah me bogus
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah me know
Yeah she knew too , it made her love it
Her pussy like me, her heart like "fuck it"
So dance for daddy like Gator
Ain't no partners on this trip
And lose yourself in my room
And find yourself in my grip
I'm sayin'
My druggy
When I'm ugly
Hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy
I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost
I blessed myself inside your arms one day
Swear to God there I was when the dress
And the silver buttons fade away
Miss Mary Mattress, geriatrics
Fuck me into open caskets, I wanna die with this
I wanna stop seeing my psychiatrist
She said "pill pop, baby girl 'cause I promise you, you tweaked
The empty bottled loneliness, this happiness you seek"
The masochism that you preach
Practice back flips, tragic actress
On a movie with no screen
When the only time he loves me is naked in my dreams
My druggy
When I'm ugly
Hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy
I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost
IGH!Intro: Slum Village & 
Ladies loving my music is like some sex shit
Niggas trying to grip up my mic like it's a dick 
Run around the corner to pick up the new shit 
Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep
What's good good? And what's good evil?
And what's good, gangstas? And what's good, people?
And why's God's phone die every time that I call on Him?
If his son had a Twitter wonder if I would follow him
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him
Pics of they genitalia, tallied up ten of 'em
I slurped too many pain-kills down, I'm off a lot
I got a lot off days, but it ain't often that I'm off the clock
Ya kna wha mean, I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the Stones got through
We just aiming back 'cause the cops shot you
Buck buck bang bang, yelling "Fuck Fox News!"
Booyaka buckle up, mothafuck opps too
Ain't no knuckling up 'em young 'cause it just not cool
Nice to see you Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demon's ass
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Right? IGH
I used to tell hoes I was dark light or off white
But I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white
And both my parents was black
But they saw it fit that I talk right
With my drawers hid but
My hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
But gravity had me up in a submission hold
Like I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon toed
In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole
And two missing toes
But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe
Nice to see you Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demons ass
Like Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over
The type to love from a distance not the type that told her
Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
With babies on the block under arms like fighting odors
Coppers and quotas
Hold ya head like 2Pac had taught
Obviously they are on a come up
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against us we tryna get lucky
Doper than Lucky
You're ending happy that's only a tugging
Like Satan masturbating shit come hot
But y'all still love me ugh
How father time a deadbeat
Maybe I'm adopted
That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless, IGH
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
What's better than tripping is falling in love
What's better than Letterman, Leno, Fallon, and all the above
What's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
Is the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club
What's better than paper is ballin' it up
What's better than followers is actually fallin' in love
What's better than frolicking, follies, fallin' in mud
Rolling in green pastures, wanderin', followin' love
What's better than eating is feeding your fam
What's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
What's better than leaning and needing a Xan
Is hitting your zan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land
What's better than yelling is hollerin' love
What's better than rhymes, nickels, dimes and dollars and dubs
Is dialing up your darling just for callin' her up
It ain't nothing better than fallin' in love
IGH!
I've seen it come back, back, back and forth
You hit the nail right on top of the head
I know you've seen it all before
But when it looks you in the eyes, it ain't nothin' you could say but "that's love"
That's love
That's love
That's love
Say that's love, ooh ooh
That's lo-o-ove
That's love
That's love, that's love, that's love
I LOVE you! 
I LOVE you! 
I LOVE you! 
I LOVE you!

I LOVE you! 
I LOVE you! 
I LOVE you!
That's love

That's love, that's love, that's love, that's love
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na

Introducin' Chance the Ruthless, trip 'shrooms and lucy
Dreams is lucid, loosely based on music, swallow my mucus
Hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus
Deuces Douches, deuce deuce I'll shoot ya 
Shoes might boot cha and a suit might suit cha
They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit
They use of allusion could confuse Confucius
Nasty, ashy, cigarette ashing, 'til my voice get raspy
Last week suspended, last night kissed Va$htie
Parleyed with Ashley, always in the hallway
So I never been classy 
Shut up!
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Acid, Acid, get it? Acid, melts through plastic, I spit fired
Pad my palette, talkin' paper if this was work, I'd get higher
Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered
Fart and get bitch-slapped, like bourbon mixed with Jack
Lickety-split, look it! He slipped on a shell
From peelin' banana splits back, give me my Kit-Kat
Don't break me off shit, batch, fack is you mean bitch?
Zan with that lean bitch, zan with that lean bitch
Zen with that chakra I eat it like Idi Amin
Ya kna wha' mean, hit me back when that mean shit
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Introducin', it’s Bronsonlino
With my hair slicked back, I look like Rick Pitino
Three Japanese dykes in my El Camino
Lettin' trees blow, oh
I rep the East Coast
I got a team of hoes like Pat Summitt
I look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in a black hummer
I splash summer like a fast brother, with a number on his back
Ain’t no fumblin', in fact, I'm back, acid in my hat
Shoot, then pass the gat
It's at the bottom of the river in a plastic bag
My new shorty got a gymnastic back
'87 emerald green on a classic jag
She had the cleft palate, I ordered chef’s salad
She had the club foot, with that little arm
I couldn’t help but laugh, she ordered Chicken Parm
I had the full Bulls warm-up with the Pippens on
Suck my motherfucking dick
It's the young Randy Velarde
Queens, baby
Blow me
Mmm, IGH!
Acid Rap!

Un-saran wrap the purple, wrap that blunt under after
Smoke all out the window, cops could eat a dick
If you ain't the hitter, you just might be the lick
Flame on, flame on, I'm your bitch's ringtone
She like when I rap raps, but better when I sing songs
No Drake, but I get my Trey on, killin' in the hood like Trayvon
Shoppin' like I got a coupon, savin' like I got a cape on
Cookin' crack in my apron, dressed like a nigga had 8 proms
Tell shorty I may change and I made it and I napalm
Trippy shit to watch drugs while on the clock

My name Herb, take herb, smoke herb 
How 'bout you? No dap, but I'll take a pound or two
No doubt like Gwen Stefani's group
Look, let me put my mouth where you potty, boo 
Them niggas pissed, need potty training
They movement shit, that's a potty train
She ain't left yet, but she probably came
We kicked it then I score, soccer game
She was a phony goalie, I got great aim though, don't insult me
I'll give it to ya straight, this is what she told me
My name Solo cause I'm the one and only
She only got you as a nigga on the side
That's a nigga on the side of a side bitch, homie
Then we got out a Dodge, like them Dukes of Hazzard

Chance's "Na
Na" ad-lib
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young; just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like "That's not your jersey?"
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face
I am a new man, I am sanctified
Oh, I am holy, I have been baptized
I have been born again, I am the White Light
Rain, rain don't go away
This is my last shh- my last shit
Uhh, it definitely be mad important
Ey man, that sound like a Prince song
Still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping
Motha, shut your mouth
Somebody pray for the god, oh lord
I wonder what Michael's on
Son jammin' to his shit
Rappin' trappin' trippin' 'cid
And sniffing glue and chewing Vicodin
Shoulda died- yelling YOLO was a lie
And you a liar wonder why you wanna die so young
You and I look just alike
And I'm afraid that this one right here
Might be last time that I write a song
Lot of niggas wanna go out with a bang
But I ain't tryna go out at all
So I ain’t tryna go out at all
Got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door
Last chance joint gotta be a dance joint
From an introspective drugged out standpoint
Throw bands joint, wanna hold hands joint
Old school for my own old man joint
Still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping
Motha, shut your mouth
This part right here, right now
Right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car
I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit
I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit
I hope you love all of my shit 
Why toss my filter when she saved my life?
The same shit that kills us, always feels so right
That's why I pray to the dear lord
God know who he be
Truth be told he juiced me
Introduced me to the lucy leaf
Oh oh oh, I seen the light, I lost my lighter
Bic flick, kick the habit and the bucket, fuck your supplier
Lies, Levis on fire
Flyer on the wall I'm brighter
In the darkness of the night
In the sky I get higher, higher
Still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping
Motha, shut your mouth
This part right here, right now
Right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car
I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit
I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit
I hope you love all of my shit 
Still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening

Chance: Oh, alright. I just wanted to say thank you for everything. For the computer, the T-Shirts, and all the other stuff

Chance, you have done remarkable and wondrous things, so you don't have to tell me thank you for anything. I'm supposed to do this, that stuff for you anyway, and ya know, just keep doing what you're doing. I am very, very proud of you. Just keep doing what you're doing, ok?
Chance: Thank you, love you

Chance: Bye bye
Thanks for coming guys
'Member sittin' in class the first time listening to Dilla
Everything's good
Rubbin' on yo chin, sippin gin, Margiela brand chinchilla
Everything's good
My manager backpack packed with packs of cigarillos
And some fruit snacks, And some killer's
Phone numbers on speed dial call them save monkey guerillas
Everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodbyes
I ain't really that bad at leaving
I ain't really always been a good guy, I used to be thirsty thievin'
Runnin through purses even persons leave em hurtin' bleedin
I ain't really help the helpless
I used to be worse than worthless
Now I'm worth hooks and verses
I'm good like books in churches
Harolds and Hooks and Churches
Everything's Good
See my name when you google search it
Use a card when I make a purchase
Everything's Good
But I knew it was fly when I was just a caterpillar
That I'd make it even if I never make a milla,
When I meet my maker he gon' make sure that we chillin'
And everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodnight, I ain't really that bad at sleepin
With bad bitches, put them aside, I used to be thirsty creeping
Now I'm out working evenings birthdays even Tuesdays Wednesdays Thursdays weekends, rehearsing verses, murdering merch and events
Damn it feel good to be a gangsta
And it feel good for me to thank you
Put money back in your bank account
Off of songs I barely could think up,
Cause a lot of songs niggas gon' make up
Make sense, but they never gon' make a sound
I'm better than I was the last time, crescendo
Thanks Justin, lending them pencils
Mr. Menzies, Mensa, Chris Minto
The time I beat Chris on Nintendo
Nanana hey hey, good intro,

Remember the first time you heard this through and thought, "damn that's that nigga."
Everything's good
Never let me down
For the kings have decreed 
Righteousness shall be
Show us thy love, oh
Have mercy upon thy soul
Never let me down, no man
Happened today like nothing
DJ Khaled!
I wanna say thank you for the time and the love that you share
All the help and the effort just to get me there
When everyone turned their back you showed me how muched you care
You believed in me, never forget you I swear
I'll always be strong, my character defines me
I will never be that hateful and throw stones behind me
Temptation and ego can get you so wrong
A lot of people easily forget where they're comin' from
I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul
With the riches of love forever
Happiness shine as a burning sun
It's a blooming blessing, hey
Let it flow, it's a pleasure
Hours upon hours searching for a better way out
And the evil and ignorant people sending the choppers
Still just gotta look out
Jah is my guide, I know I'm here for a reason
Put my trust in the Most High
And my prayers are so consistent, ah
Who would've thought it would be like this today?
Nothing but prayers lift up your head
Lion in the jungle, I tell ya
He who have been blessed...
Welcome to Grateful

Held up my left wrist like I'm Harden 
Ran to the dealer, bought twin Mercedes
The European trucks for the twin babies
Don't let me have a son, I'm a fool, haha 
Send him to school in all my jewels, haha

I done sacrificed it all, paid the dues and costs
Life will test us all, let's see if we true or false
I walk up to my fate and stare that shit in the face
Hungry for the competition, bitch, get on my plate
No mercy, no grace, I'm checkin' off my to-do list
There's no room off in the schedule
It's only room for improvement
And I realized all I ever needed was in me, nigga
S on my chest, boy, so shots can't even pinch me, nigga
No substitute for me, but they gon' still tempt me, nigga
God is in me, that's the only one who can end me, nigga
And we seen more blessings than a Baptist Ebenezer
My daddy says: "You got a good girl, she's a keeper."
Boy, I'm a Caesar, I see shit and seize it
Roc-A-Fella chain, but you can still get Ether'd
Yeah, they don't really fuckin' feel me

I'm principle driven, only real ones feel me
Most needed protection from the OG's to get bigger
No disrespect to them, but I never needed them older niggas
Or so we thought speedin' through life like
The speed of sound – what your life like?
Momma stressin', seen the ratchets in the dresser
She not askin' questions
Seen the vests, seen other kids in the caskets restin'
Life ill, 'cause most of my niggas in jail
For them it was hustle or death, I reshuffled my deck
I gave myself a good hand
Probably ran through a hundred million
Per decade, I'm not phased, and I could spot ya
A hundred million before you could ever spot grays

Resort to violent reactions
That's childish, my life's a dream to rappers
Afraid they moments have past 'em
It's all different hustles 
Niggas movin' bricks
Young niggas rappin', doin' shows, hittin' they licks
Everybody holdin' shmoney in pics
Don't get robbed, boy, is you dumb?
All them swipers gettin' it how it come 
43, morally ambiguous, you serious?
Gettin' it, lyricist, idiots, you ain't nearin' this
Out of New York's biggest and richest
I'm the template, low-key the busiest
The game chose me, deal with it
So I'm the quiet type, Mr. One Mic
But silently listen, use the same letters to spell it right
So hear me, from Nasty I'm mature
Here's another appetizer

My money is longer, my weed is stronger
All my bitches is badder, these niggas is sadder
My rubies got chalice so fuck all the chatter
Tissued the money, I rest on them plaques
King of the Patek, clarity showing without even knowing
Jump out that Lambo with the red bottoms on
The capital going up heavy in Florence

Another one
Yeah
We the Best Music!
DJ Khaled!
Please, Khaled, don't pair me or compare me
Unless the said party is a rare breed
The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me
At this point now, rap is only therapy
President Push, I'm more Eric B
I ain't no joke, check out my melody
Felony, felony, felony, that's all they selling me
But two million in large bills is billing me
I was on the wrong side of the law
Like Pac was on the wrong side of the car
Like B.I.G. at the Soul Train Awards
The moral is all greats been driven
G-Wagons are bulletproof
The ones before me got snatched like bullet tooth
Tony nigga, only one left from the drug era
The jewelry weighs more in the drug mirror
Yeah, what you see when you look in the mirror, nigga? Haha
Yeah, I know who the fuck I am
Yuugh, tell me how you fit in
Was you a street nigga when Nas said It's Written
When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living?
I was leading up the grinding in my kitchen
Getting work from Detroit like a piston
We was on a mission, stuff it in a Michelin
I could spend a year reminiscing
The length of your career, reminiscing
We can't occupy the same space
We ain't even running the same race
When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase
Moynat versus Celine, we ain't the same taste
Therefore, it's no comparison
To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing
I am one Joe blow, you know my narrative
Clear your sinus like Claritin
Push
When you look in the mirror, what do you see, nigga?
'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see
You peasants don't deserve my presence
You portraying other individuals
Me, I'm just weighing my residuals
From where success is the bare minimal
You a rapper, I'm a criminal
I had money before they found y'all
That's why I feel funny around y'all
Lord, bless those praying for my downfall
If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all
Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key
Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D
Had the whole YPD sick of me
Don't sit, if you get tired, just pick a knee
Bet it all or bet it large
Now the coke or the pills or the crack, all these credit cards
I just laughed and I shrug at it
'Cause the niggas with the money are the drug addicts
Kiss
DJ Khaled!
From the mud to the marble floors, minks galore
Hustlin' on the corners, now we own the stores
Fuck a million dollars, boy, I need a billi' for sure
Ch-ch-ch-cheer tuckin' Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean
More Billy's, more problems
We got too many ways to solve 'em
My life is like a movie that made the Oscars
Turned a key into a billion dollars, Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean
I got my car back, I'm John Wick
The sky blue tint come equipped with the convicts
The don's slick, some Billys we gon' get
Broke a leg in my debut, no Bogut 
Talkin' sports trades with Pecas
While sides cheat on their husbands, those be the best vibes
Satin grain on the hood of the car
Switch lanes, yeah I used to flood the hood with them jars
You can get a taste for a flat out key
'Cause now-a-days I'm Klay, see my spot up 3
Draped in Hermes scarves, crusing the Riviera
More solid than gold bars, the Billy era
From the mud to the marble floors, minks galore
Hustlin' on the corners, now we own the stores
Fuck a million dollars, boy, I need a billi' for sure
Ch-ch-ch-cheer tuckin' Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean
More Billy's, more problems
We got too many ways to solve 'em
My life is like a movie that made the Oscars
Turned a key into a billion dollars, Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean
Hermes sweatsuits and S-Coupes
Fly around, NBA money in jets too
Back of the bag's all crunched out, we vexed too
Should've been Billys in '92, line who? The shine's new
Yeah it's sorta like a mafia movie
Sit back, Rocky and Groovie with the '9-2
Silk pieces in Velez's sneakers
A duffle bag with handcuffs on it, we creatures
Ayo, runnin' every strip club, lit love
Yeah we sit around and just drip bub', the homies get piff love
To all the realest ones and rich thugs
One, my hundred niggas, Billy, we gun on niggas
From the mud to the marble floors, minks galore
Hustlin' on the corners, now we own the stores
Fuck a million dollars, boy, I need a billi' for sure
Ch-ch-ch-cheer tuckin' Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean
More Billy's, more problems
We got too many ways to solve 'em
My life is like a movie that made the Oscars
Turned a key into a billion dollars, Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean

I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes

Jumping out with your bae
I just wanna get this paper
I got you, Khaled, it's Wizop
It's the Dapper Don going on a trapathon
Serving coked out food and kush, I call it a triathlon
In a red Dawn with an Amazon
She pissed me off, I just found out she got her panties on
A year ago seen niggas get stabbed over honey buns
It may sound funny to you, found out he got punctured lungs
I just want the funds, I don't rap for fun
I rarely post the money, I never pose with guns
Went from a robber to the upper upper echelon
Just to get here I had to rob a couple Mexicans
But free Kodak Black, bring Lil' Kodak back
Cause they don't wanna see you move into their cul-de-sac
I'ma go get that Wraith
Jumping out with your bae
I just wanna get this paper
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper
I'ma go, I'ma go, I'ma go get that Wraith
Jumping out with your bae
I just wanna get this paper
It's do or die on my side of things
Destiny is my livelihood
I'm Iverson with the long braids
Three cellphones with the gold fronts
Wild thing 'til I Yao Ming
Five rings, past nine seasons
Big money, that's our thing
Heavyweight, I Ali 'em
Featherweight how I leave 'em
Heaven's sakes, God's need 'em
Bob weave rock the Colosseum
I'm the biggest nigga, you got gonorrhea
Baddest bitches make my collage
Biggest buds make my cigars
Basic bitches and custom cars
Blowjobs in the SLR's
Realest ones wanna watch you shine
Smoking good and I'm talking facts
Iced out like DJ Khaled
Burn it down with Kodak Black
I'ma go get that Wraith
Jumping out with your bae
I just wanna get this paper
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper

DJ Khaled!
Fucked the DA on my way here
I made some millions on my way here nigga
I seen your comment on my way here
I laughed my ass off on my way here nigga
Bentayga with the brain bust open
That new Mulsanne got the brain bust open
Play them racks like Jimi Hendrix on the guitar
Load my gun, cock it back and then I push start
I can't name how many times they tried to clone me
I can't name all the names that tried to clone me
This dirty money help me see the devil
Sidity thots, know they ain't forever
My trials and tribulations playing out on blogs
Spend three hundred thousand or better, that's on all the cars
The Maybach park itself, nigga
That Range Rover came with steps, nigga
Electric tables in the back, I'm eating filet mignon
He been 44'n all year, I put that Rollie on
Trapping good all year, put the Rollie on
They parading in the streets, you gotta keep a drum
Say a prayer for my young nigga, know he dumb
The murder rate going up nigga
I done ran this check up nigga
Get hit up from the neck up nigga, yeah
The Goyard looking like a graveyard
Murder money, I'm in love with murder money
Old friends of me turned into my enemy
My money and fame changes niggas into enemies
All my hard work and lonely nights no sympathy
Want to send a hit but too far in the industry
I feel your energy, I know you niggas envy me
They rep the gang that bangin' it out in penitentiary
I watch the shit come out your mouth and it's finicky
I'm tryna love you but I doubt I'll scream infinity
With these billions on my mind, it's hard to be cohesive
Gettin' that A-Rod money like I hit the needle
Keep a spanish mamacita like a Fanta liter
And I gave 'em all dope and they pissed off
Got my lil Haiti babies waiting so they can wack ya
I got my Memphis Ten niggas waiting to jack ya
I got some DC niggas waiting to kidnap ya
I got the clappers, finessers and the trappers
Before the rap change, you gotta go dap em
Don't forget to look at niggas when they after ya
I told Future I can see the future
Told my bitch I love you 'fore I knew you
I know I'm blessed nigga, hallelujah 
And if you diss me then I might shoot ya 
You don't fuck with me, the feeling mutual 
Half these rap niggas owe they jeweler 
I was selling keys to success
I was coppin' keys outta Texas
New Wraith with the stars in it
New Porsche, condo, living room cars in it
Ace of Spades with the Percocet and bars in it
Young shooters, real soldiers put they heart in it
Let's talk 'bout all this money we make and all these niggas they hatin'
Let's talk 'bout runnin' that bag up fast cause we ain't got no patience
Let's talk 'bout poppin' 'scripts and Xans like we're patients
And them fed's allegations will have you pacin'
Million dollar dope boy, I gotta be grateful
You tryna get that 100 mil', I'ma race you
Dope boy, I ain't never wanna be a rap nigga
Billboard reporter LA Reid just signed a trap nigga
New York Times read Jay Z just signed a trap nigga
Kitchen like it's Thursday, you heard? Might bring it back nigga
You fuckin' the money up if I'm being honest
Gotta be grateful, I never break the promise, I know my plug love me
I know my bitch hate me, I heard my hood salty
I tried to tell 'em it ain't my fault, it's just my blessings called me
But since they hatin' on an nigga I'ma keep ballin'
And I ain't textin' that bitch back because she keep stallin'
If she ain't fuckin first night then she just miss her callin'
Fuck a plea, I'm goin' to trial, poker face, I'm all in
Patek Philippe, AP, 40 mil', I’m all in
Plug hit my line I act like I ain't see 'em callin'
I worked so hard for mine I'm tryna get some free bands
I'm the king of the city, my house Graceland
No respect for rappers, they respect the coke man
That's why your favorite rapper actin' like the dope man nigga
All these diamonds on my fingers
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
We the Best Music!
You can hear my diamonds talkin'

Jewelry lookin' like a slushie fresh up out the blender
Maybe I hit her, maybe I didn't
Even if I did, I don't remember
Been a player since the very beginning
Stones in my charm, never my denim, no
Chain flooded like the livin' room, huh, incredible
Rappin', it was either that or sellin' dope, shit, let the dice roll
Now diamonds all on top of diamonds, huh?
Drippin', let you know I gotta go

Money on your head, you might get hit up today
You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke
In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone
My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater
I, got my hand flooded, I, bought the whole projects
I, got my hood stuntin', this whatever
I, charged the whole 30, I, got my niggas workin'
I, got my bitches down for whatever
 Whatever!
 Whatever!

Pay up like I've been runnin' it up forever
I ran that shit up through the roof
Young nigga ran that shit up for his mother
Buy her everything and I got proof
Up, designer fit, ain't known to buy it
And I done whipped every tire
With the brake pad, "Mello Yello", catch up
Ring me up like your pop-pop, whatever you need to
I skeet then skeet off in a new coupe, keep up!
That V-12 'bout to heat up, grab your seatbelt, your seatbelt
The color of my boxers, yeah I'm Tommy'd up
Got the Tommy tucked, ayy
I toss that shit up like a spray, watch it spill on the clothes
I soak that shit up when they told me "Don't matter, boss won"
I suspended these bitches and I subpoenaed these niggas
To see who was real
I supported my bank account and I wouldn't tell you the account
Money on your head, you might get hit up today
You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke
In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone
My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater

I, charged the whole 30, I, got my niggas workin'
I, got my bitches down for whatever
 Whatever!
 Whatever!
 Maybach Music
DIamonds all on my fingers, misses still miscellaneous
Left the ski-mask in the 'Rari, residencies out in Vegas
Smoking like Calvin Broadus, blueberry with the big homie
Idols becoming rivals, down to die for my survival
Fell in love with the money, she at the spot every Sunday
Loyalty's what I lust, how I measure my woman
Minimize my mistakes, love every tat on my face
DJ Khaled my blood, got several M's in my safe
Money on your head, you might get hit up today
You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke
In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone
My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater
I, got my hand flooded, I, bought the whole projects

 2 Chainz
Watch me break down bales, residue on scales
Yeah, I had the girls sick, man I cure like nails
Competition might fail, repetition might sell
Dirty kitchen, dirty dishes, dirty bitches, oh well
Foreign whip rider, lobster on my rider, uh
You can get the platter, uh, I put my money up
You gon' need a ladder, work, no acrobatics
Work, no calisthenics, my dick be acting stingy
My check be acting boujee, my car got all the groupies
I bought a new Rolex now my old Rolex tryna sue me
Fashion on exotic, pistol on regardless
Bitches look like Barbie, Ricky Bobby on my trolly
Tryna set a bando on fire
I'm just tryna get you so higher
Money coming in, we get flyer
You must be tryna wife her like Tiger
Money on your head, you might get hit up today
You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke

My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater

I thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding hide yo kittens, hit yo children with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hard headed, never listen
Purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic Christians, the land of no religion
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my benjis and my Bentley, and them bitches now I gets gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit till I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me
Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE
Riding through your city like that motherfucka mine
Or choking on that semi, rob a motherfucka blind
License plate says wipe me down, car from 1989
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine
Lost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind niggas talking down
Never talk to cops, make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back I'm talking 'bout your mom
Cause there's killers in my town, making hits, sniffing lines
Out committing crimes, wait for shit to simmer down
Corrupted little minds, 8 and 9, finna shine
On the grind, do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya
Where they shoot without a purpose, services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it, can't survive a thing, you're worthless
Strangers make me nervous, who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains?
Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE
Pretty nigga rich, Flacko be the shit
And that bitch, know we poppin' so she boppin' on this dick
Nigga, R.I.P. to Pimp, can't forget Little Flip
And I take it out to Memphis so shout out to Triple Six
Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE
I said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off
Let's take it to the basis, you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers ain't us
So tell me what your name is, I'mma tell it to my stainless
You aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G
Low key, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass
I said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off
Yes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up some money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to complement the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, "Tell it to my face"
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits
I'm the shit, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig-Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass
I said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off
All I think about is life, nights, sipping on Sprite

Be that pretty mothafucka, you could call me what you wanna
Cause I'm in love with that ass, she in love with the cash
So she shaking it fast and then making them stacks
And I'm taking it back and I'm taking her back
To the house just to bust in her mouth and I'm kicking her out

So I say pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed

It's A$AP Q, where the bread at?
Fuck around and bring the hush puppies back
She fuck me and the homies, she was cool with that
The block hot so I'm shaded in my bucket hat
Pause a little bit, I gotta little advice
If you fucked her once, then you could fuck her twice
And don't get head from hoes with overbites
Just giving out game, nigga show your right
Born stunna nigga, turn night to bright
High as a kite in my Nike Flights
Made 30 Racks it was just a flight
Flew a bitch out too, it was just a night
Shorty got the booty make a nigga say, "Whoa"
Can I suck your titties, tryna see how far I can go
Try again and then again and she ain't telling me no
Sweetie tell me how you feeling, can I feel on you more?
She said, "I ain't fucking for free," but ain't shit I can't afford
Shit, I'll pay you for it, now bounce that ass on my bungie cord

Riding by the rules I'll abide by it soon

The game's full of posers, big dog bulldozer
Pop up on 'em like toasters, wake 'em up like Folgers

You could bet the crib and car, just renew the title

Dead alive, it’s in my repertoire, forever ever high
I never lie, never tell a lie, I would testify
Set aside dreams, I’m a king ask Coretta Scott
Cute faced, fat ass, and a nice set of thighs
Rihanna weave, I need a umbrella, ella, ella, ah
Everybody knows me, shit, still ain’t got no cash

However, whatever they seeing on the box
Everybody spit, everybody hot, everybody's an artist, everybody not
S-O L-O-S-T, niggas talking dollars getting change
In a minute I'mma lose my cool, Sprewell one year before '98
Like fuck coach, I’m cutthroat, so what goes
Do you head for the year they say might be the end?
Better look within
Glitz and the glamors, we pose for the cameras
Ghetto niggas with me, they pose with the hammers
Ghetto girls with me, pink toes in the sandals
No dirty laundry, get your nose out my hamper
Clothes in my hamper, that bathing ape camouflage
Brands from Japan, you would think I was a samurai
Drop-crotch Jeremy Scott pants, bitch it’s Hammer Time
Getting dirty money but I keep my hand sanitized

Oh word? Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju… 
Then just drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it

The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick

Wake up feeling blessed up, pistol on that dresser
Ain't afraid to show it, I'll expose it if I dress up
Riding in that Testa...rossa, nigga catch up
Sipping on that syrup 'til I'm messed up like yes sir
So now I'm getting change, people looking at me strange
Like nigga switching lanes, never changed, still the same
We fuck bitches, get paper, you fuck niggas on papers
We walk around with lasers, you prolly own some tasers
Lame niggas disgrace us, they girlfriends want date us
Got different hoes, I'm pimping hoes, you could tell by my paystubs
My niggas gettin' right, smokin' weed with dirty Sprite
Going wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'
Finna wild out for the weekend, me, myself, and I – my three friends
Nigga feeling froggy, then leap in, A$AP niggas finna sneak in
Middle finger to the critics, me and my nigga Skrillex
You know we finna kill it, A$AP we the trillest
You don't really want that Glock boy
You don't really wanna feel them shots boy
You a b-boy, I'm a block boy, I'm a D boy, I'm a hot boy
Six shots got me feelin' like Pac, boy, party all night, shit don't stop, boy
Drunk as fuck and I'm ready to fight
Wilding for the night, fuck being polite, boy
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
It's the weekend and I'm creeping with my niggas
Drunk and disrespectful, callin' women bitches

Meet us in the cut and we can do the business
God my witness that I only wanna kick it
And your girl just said they with us
So we rolling in them Benzes
Won't you pour it up and stop the babysitting
She got drunk as fuck and swallowed all my kids
Back to the Mac, tats on her back

When it clap from the back, she clappin' it back
She flat on her back and it's back to the trap
Fuck your pack, A$AP where it's at
Fuck nigga act, get clap lay flat

Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Feeling like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetary with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinking 'bout all the O's in my bank account 
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount 
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
 Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably selling D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off, in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "DOO DOO!" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm mmm,"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff
Barely even conscious, talking to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginning again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? GREAT. Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothing but a buckshot, Ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it’s like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I’ve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham
Big KRIT, shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask Le
Bron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er, nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?
I’m more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers, a true artist
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"

I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a jiggy nigga
Rocking, rolling, swagging to the max
My bitch a fashion killa, she be busy popping tags
She got a lotta Prada, that Dolce and Gabbana
I can't forget Escada, and that Balenciaga
I'm sipping purple syrup, come be my Aunt Jemima
And if you is a rider, we'll go shopping like mañana
Her attitude Rihanna, she get it from her mama
She jiggy like Madonna, but she trippy like Nirvana
Cause everything designer, her jeans is Helmut Lang
Shoes is Alexander Wang and her shirt the newest Donna
Karan, wearing all the Cartier frames
Jean Paul Gaultiers cause they match with her persona
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a trendy nigga
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a jiggy nigga
I see your Jil Sanders, Oliver Peoples
Costume National, your Ann Demeuelemeester
See Visvim be the sneaker, Lanvin or Balmain
Goyard by the trunk, her Isabel Marant
I love your Linda Farrow, I adore your Dior
Your Damir Doma, Vena Cava from the store
I crush down with that top down, bossy see how I ride 'round
Mami in that Tom Ford, Papi in that Thom Browne
Rick Owens, Raf Simons, boy she got it by the stock
She ball until she fall, that means she shop 'til she drop
And Versace: got a lot, but she may never wear it
But she save it so our babies will be flyer than their parents
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a trendy nigga
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a jiggy nigga
Scoop back tees, breeze in the coupe
Smiling is your treasure, you're so well put together
Bags and links, jeans and shoes
Spikes and patent leathers, different fabrics mixed together
You and me, me and you
Go away together, we could get away forever
All emotions clashing, thrashing, someone turn the light out
I met my baby expressed my passion on my fashion night out
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a trendy nigga
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a jiggy nigga
Bloody ink on my pad spelled suicide
Michael Jackson even passed cause you scrutinized
Fuck illuminati lies, say I'm lucified
Baptised in the gutter, motherfucker you decide
Cause the ride come with doors that be suicide
Or the thighs on my whores, they be super-sized
Good and bad having wars, nigga, choose a side
Now all hail to the Lord like you do to God
Who am I? Lord Flacko
Painting vivid pictures, call me Basquiat, Picasso
Capo Head Hancho, now my following's colossal
Ain't no boxer, Pacquiao, but got the chopper todo caso
It's like you heard God spoke, I seen the ghetto gospel
The choir like my reefer and the preacher got my eyes low
Sister Mary Jane to make me sleep from singing high notes
The bible or the rifle, goodnight folks
Bloody ink on my pen spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died cause you scrutinize
It's a fine line between truth and lies
Jesus Christ never lied, still was crucified
That's why I never judge another nigga
Life's a bitch, but that bitch in love with other niggas
3 to a bed, sheets, no covers nigga
Dirty kitchen, no supper in the cupboards nigga
Sucker niggas, wassup with niggas?
So my new attitude is like "Fuck them niggas!"
I grew up with niggas but don't fuck with niggas
I don't trust them niggas, ain't got no love for niggas
Had the gold grills shining like them southern niggas
Kept it trilla, now the whole world fuckin' with us
Meanwhile you treated all of us like other niggas
Now your world is in my palm, take cover niggas
If I shall ever fall, Lord pick me up
Ever since a baby, two deuce in sippy cups
Ever since them diapers and my zip-me-ups
Now I'm walking on my own, y'all, wish me luck
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan
I swear this famous shit just happened overnight
For sure these hoes was so uptight, but now they so polite
All I see is fake love, smiles and overbites
But I'm pimping, nigga: Dolemite
I remember when, I was like ten, maybe nine
Ricky had a deuce-deuce, two shotty pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes, Puffy had the Shyne
Bone Thugs had Mo Thugs but that was the shit, that made me rhyme
What's up, what's on your mind? Hold up, I'm feeling fine
Locs got me blind, thugging like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess that's why the crackers kept me after school
Roaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
On the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights
And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds
And one click left two down, that's four kids but one lived
Left three dead, but one split, that one miss, that one snitched
That's everyday shit, shit we used to that
Add it up, do the math with your stupid ass
Don't view me as no conscious cat, this ain't no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap, my mac'll push your conscience back
I do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah, Daddy in the kitchen whipping soda
Cook-connect named Sosa, Spanish chick Viola hit it in the chocha
With the Testarossa, hit Daytona, fuck the law, we soldiers
I'm 'bout it 'bout it, nigga ain't shit sweet about me
The baddest bitches on the block be even speaking 'bout me
I'm so thuggish ruggish bringing ruckus, knucking if you bucking
Young and thugging, bugging showing out in public, but you love it
I only got one vision, that's for kids in every color, religion
That listen, we gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision, but we all God children, we siblings
You my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin
Back once again
Chilling in the back of the 'Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend
Then a nigga smash, I'll be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin
Then it's back to the back of the Benz
Lean back in the back with the Henn and a crap
When I tap that that, then attack, never tax, never that that
Max on the ends, spend ends, I remember way back when
A mothafucka used to have to borrow cash from my friends
Friends, just to put a snack up in the fridge
When I'm on, I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me
Them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say what's up to me
From ugly to comfortably, suddenly
It all changed man, it was just like yesterday
Times was so ugly and now I'm comfortable
I just only can thank God, suddenly
Everything changed before my eyes by my surprise
A$AP
Bitch motherfuckers trying to fake it trill
Sneak diss you just to make a bill
Now the world won't take you serious
When I met you, you was painting nails
Leave a motherfucker layin' still
B-bang him with the stainless steel
Cause I'm making the order
Laugh at the altar, pullin' a Lord up
Don't get someone sawed up
Your brain in a sawdust, niggas is washed up
I bang out in Florida
Shoot in Miami, goons out in Georgia
Been to New Orleans
But still a New Yorker, nigga the talk of
Town, nigga we bossed up
Bounce, but when you talk to the Lord
Of course you're forced to
Bow down like a motherfuckin' peasant
Still that pretty motherfucker
And you know Harlem's what I'm reppin' nigga
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my niggas
I’ll die for my niggas, man, fuck them other niggas!
Lord, please talk to me Lord
I am here for you Lord
Gettin' faded, hair gettin' braided, Sophie sniffed a line of ye
Playin' spades, bumpin' Jimi Hendrix "Purple Haze"
A 40 to the face, call my homies from around the way
Give me that pussy, I'll be on my way
But grab the jimmy so the bitch don't get no cash up out me
Pretty nigga, I'm a jiggy nigga, ask about me
Fuck niggas talkin' trash about me
But you know I toke a gauge, it can make any problem go away
Talkin' Jay, talkin' Ye, that mean you niggas talkin' cray
Razor blade across your face, I fix my face then walk away
I guess then there's nothin' more to say
Trill nigga to the death, whether Hell or the pearly gates
I think back to my early days
Whippin' and pinchin' that broad dough
It's a bit different now, switchin' and flippin' that raw flow
Substance get me higher, reefer and some fire
The devil is a liar, biased preachers shall retire
Jesus walked on water, I'm preachin' to the choir
Long live A$AP, now bow to your Messiah, bitch!
Let the Lords toast with the Lords
Toast to the Lords
When come Gods, come Lords
Lords! Lords! Lords!
Oh Lord! Toast to the Lords!
As we live this day, please pray for us
When comes the saints, comes the evils, brings the Lords
Do just what I tell you
Don't come in any closer
And no one will get hurt
‘Cause I don't know how long I can hold my heart in two
A rebel I be one day, on that track with Gunplay
Outcast my whole life so I decide to spit like André
Beef is on my entree, gin and juice, that's Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one-way
Pussy on a Sunday, business on a Monday
My new crib came with feng shui and my closet is like a runway
Come be my fiancee, she fuck me in a Hyundai
My rooftop got a lounge, just sit around and watch her sunbathe
Dinner date for one K, shopping date for two K
Bougie-ass bitch made me wait to fuck for two days
Finally got it today, swear to god my mood changed
Top off like toupees, drop off, touche
Yeah, my mouth is full of gold and I'm a city boy
And my outfit was in Vogue, I'm a pretty boy
Bounce, boy, Flacko tell 'em holla at a nigga, G
Riding on my enemies, this my ghetto symphony
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Whipping Whitney, my mama as a witness
Bitches lickin' and locking up my swishas
Once she blow my whistle, she know it's dismissal
Spread the news I'm official, now hop out my foreign vessel
Before I get aggressive forget it, war ready
Already tested, tears and blood invested
Till my cardiac's arrested and my 40 ounce is empty
Show me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that
Black magic on the tires only I
Rolling down a lonely mile, phony smile
Warrants, police on me now, still tourin'
And my chain it may slow me down cheer for
Pain, in its purest form
Don't complain I came to reign from here forward, still noid
So crib got clear doors
Burning planes in my Air Force and all I can see is clear ports
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer...
Since Rocky spit like André, I'm gon' kill 'em like Big Boi
These rappers is on my entrée, eat 'em like cookies, Chips Ahoy
Mm, enjoy, when I get annoyed, know a couple niggas that'll kill for joy
Either Gunplay, runway, trip avoid, body get found by a lil' fishin' boy
Arnold Schwarzenigga, toss a nigga
Like codeine mixed with a roid
Slow punch make a nigga chin collide
That's for talking how fast you could grip a nine
Damn, look how the hollow tip hit his spine
Little motherfuckers that commit the crime
These niggas got the sidewalk sipping wine
Guess that's why the ground sip the wine
Pouring liq so I soak in lift and shine
Tip tipped and toe I miss the sky
My soul gets cold when my niggas died
So and so, niggas live and die
Beneath shoe soles you will reside
Rappers get a mil for these freakin' lies
Sign a couple deals for these freakin' lies
How many times in your eyes has a nigga died? Never!
Spittin' it like a Beretta, nobody do it better, nigga
Ten gold chains, wood grain, propane
Sell the whole thang from the cellphone rang
I'm the dope mane, bitches sniffing cocaine
All my young niggas know that they could always
Call me, call me, call me 
Call me, call me, call me 
Call me, call me, call me 
Call me, call me, call me
They call me young drug dealer, they call me young thug nigga
24 karats my slugs glitter, 24 years old worth a couple million
Shouts out to my cuz niggas, finna let it fly for my blood niggas
Middle finger up to you fuck niggas, if you a trill nigga, then fuck with us
Nigga dash like a speed of a bullet
With a pistol on him prolly wouldn't even pull it
Heart made of pudding mean mugging with a hoodie like what's goodie
Trying to be the mothafucka that you couldn't knowing you
Down to let it fly when I shouldn't
All my young niggas they gon' rep it to the fullest
Tell a fuck nigga "be you," fuck tough be cool
All the young niggas in my crew, they down to let it fly
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me 
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me 
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me 
For a nigga like me, jiggy young nigga like me 
Ten gold chains, wood grain, propane
Sell the whole thang from the cellphone rang
Ten gold chains, wood grain, propane
Sell the whole thang from the cellphone rang
Niggas got rips in they jeans man I started that
Hood by air man I started that
Niggas claim they the God of black
Well your name is purple I'm the God of that
Gave you my back nigga pardon that
Fuck that shit I brought mobbing back
I brought robbin' back, I brought the Garden back
Motherfuck black land I brought Harlem back
Rolling in my Benzo, hoes on the curb a couple of friends
Rolling down my window, yo what's the word, fuck it get in
Ride round with these bimbos, she give head to my kin folk
Shout outs my connect though, keep a watch out for them Winslows
Cause the boys gon' creep, D-boys gon' serve
Hoes gone skeet and the V gone swerve
I'mma get by while the world gon' turn
I'mma get mine like you gon' get yours
Niggas do the least do when the piece got nerve
Niggas in the streets want heat, get burned
Tell a nigga "be you," fuck tough be cool
Couple young niggas down with my crew who be done and let it fly
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me 
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me 
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me 
For a nigga like me, jiggy young nigga like me 
Ten gold chains, wood grain, propane

Ten gold chains, wood grain, propane
Sell the whole thang from the cellphone rang
Ten gold chains, wood grain, propane
Sell the whole thang from the cellphone rang
Ten gold chains, wood grain, propane
Sell the whole thang from the cellphone rang
I thought you said you’d never leave
I think back as I took a puff
Know what happens every time you leave
Always come back ‘cause you wanna fuck
Always come back ‘cause you wanna fuss
Holdin’ back, ain’t no turnin’ back when you fall in love
Know what happens every time you speed
Always fall flat ‘cause you wanna rush
So we could take it slow
Separate the highs from the lows
Separate the evens from the odds
I just hope you put me back together when I come apart
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever
I woke up today high
Felt a little less pressure from you
And I’m here to say I
Maybe even learned a lesson from you
If you find a way to fight the pain which we endure
If you fly away then rest assured
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever
You’re the eye, but I’m tearing all the time
Always there to catch me, but I’m never coming down
Reconstructing all the pieces I left in my way
I guess you know, in control
Chaos I create
I come apart
You made a bet with me, now you’re in debt with me
Made my bed, lied in it, then you slept with me
It’s ruthless, she the closest thing next to me
The truth is, that she blew it and you left with me
Especially hard to express to me
European attitude but born in West Philly
She just have a smokin’ ‘gina, where the Wet Willies?
I come apart, I’m in her heart on her left titty
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever
And we back
And we back, and we back, and we back, and we back, and we
And we back, and we back, na, na, na
This ain't no intro, this the entree
Hit that intro with Kanye and sound like André
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancée
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie Yoncé
Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll prolly cry at my own service, igh, igh!
It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
Y'all know wha' mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the Word
This is the sheep that ain't like what it herd
This is officially first
This is the third
This is the bom bom bom
Bom bom bom
Bom bom bom
Music is all we got
So we might as well give it all we got
This is the bom bom bom
Bom bom bom
Bom bom bom
Music all we got, got, got
So we might as well give it all we got
I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothing away
You gotta fight for your way
And that don't take nothing away
Cause at the end of the day
Music is all we got
Music is all we got
Isn't this all we got?
So we might as well give it all we got
Music is all we got
Music is all we got
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
Music

Bitch I know you tried to cheat, you shoulda never took a nap, hey
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?

They be like, "There he go!"
You old Petey Pablo, take your shirt off
Wave 'round your head like a helicopter
I ain't put enough weed in the blunt
All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from?
Yeezy said he ain't make them
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mommas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea
Big yacht, no power steering
Aye, aye, captain
I'm high, captain
I'm so high
Me and God dappin'
This is my blessin'
This is my passion
School of hard knocks
I took night classes
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Yep, yep!
Pull up in the new thing, I'm like
They be like, "There he go!"
I got problems bigger than these boys
My deposits, they be on steroids
Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, toes up
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby
Mula, baby

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
They say so, ridin' with the payo'
They be like, "There he go!"
Oh, oh, oh, incredible
My lord...incredible
I believe...
Socks on concrete, jolly rancher kids
I was talking back and now I gotta stay at grandma's crib
Bunch of tank top, nappy headed bike-stealing Chatham boys
None of my niggas ain't had no dad
None of my niggas ain't have no choice
JJ, Mikey, Lil Derek and them
79th street was America then
Ice cream truck and the beauty supply
Blockbuster movies and Harold's again
We still catching lightning bugs
When the plague hit the backyard
Had to come in at dark cause the big shawtys act hard
Okay now, day camp at Grand Crossing
First day, nigga's shooting
Summer school get to losing students
But the CPD getting new recruitment
Our summer don't, our summer
Our summer don't get no shine no more
Our summer die, our summer time don't got no time no more
Summer friends don't stay
Summer friends don't stay, stay around
Summer friends, summer friends
Summer friends don't stay
Summer friends don't stay, hey
Stay around here
Oh I used to kill 'em with the long hair
Momma hair salon doing perms out the armchair
Dad was working late, he treat the crib like it's a timeshare
I would mow some lawns
Fold my ones like a lawn chair, hugh, hugh!
Now I'm the same way, over time all the time, every night, hey
Ready my blessing, now I'm ready how I wait
Never let a friendship get in my way
Never let a blog get in my way
Make the whole song do whatever I say
79, 79, 79, place
79, 79, 79, place
Some of my homegirls got lost in the paperwork
They was good friends but I faked the flirt
Cause if it ain't work, can't make it work
It's been a minute since I called on a friend
Fucked up and fucked all my friends, all my friends
All my friends, all my...
Stick around
Summer friends, summer...
You're my friend...
Summer friends don't stick around
Stick around, hey
And some of us...
79, 79, 79, hey
79, 79, 79, hey
79, 79, 79, hey, hey, hey
You're my friend
79, 79, 79, hey, 79
So put your head on my shoulder
Citywide, citywide, citywide, hey
Citywide, citywide, citywide, hey
Citywide, citywide, citywide, hey
Citywide, citywide, citywide, hey
Citywide, citywide, citywide
Citywide, citywide, citywide
Citywide, citywide, citywide
Citywide, citywide, citywide
Citywide, citywide, citywide....
I will wait around for you
I will wait around for you
So lay your head on my table
Lay your head on my table
May the Lord give your journey mercy
May you be successful, grant you favor
And bring you back safely, I love you
When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when I changed, a nigga never changed up
I always bring my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends up
When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when I changed, a nigga never changed up
I always bring my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends up
You are very special
You're special too
Everyone is special
This I know is true
When I look at you
You are very special
You're special too
Everyone is special
This I know is true
When I look at you
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus' black life ain't matter, I know I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps,  gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
Don't be mad
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up
The blessings come down
Good God
When the praises go up  the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex girl getting pregnant
And her becoming my everything
I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four minute songs
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh!
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone
When the praises go up,   the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
'Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
When did you change?
Wendy, you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never
Window closed, Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
'Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
She don't laugh the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger?
Don't you miss the days?
Don't you miss the danger?
We don't  do the same drugs no more 
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't  do the same drugs no more 
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs
Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line

Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
I swear I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
Am I the only one who really care about cover art?
Growing up I ain't have my brother
'Cause he said the streets gave him a fresh start
I ain't know what that mean
I bumped heads with my dean
Dropped out and hit the scene
Now I'm stunting like bling
Time and time again, they told me no
They told me I wouldn't go
'Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes
Well, maybe that shit was my interest
Now I spend more than they make at my dentist
After 1Night the folks thought I was finished
I pinned my name to the game like a seamstress
Oh, bitch I bite like a gator
Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper
Did what I wanted, didn't care about a hater
Delivered my tape to the world as a caterer
Oh, they fuck with me cause I'm different
New sound, new appearance
Bitch, it's Boat from the 6
Give a fuck about a bitch

Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
Angels, na, na, na, na
I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah a nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
'Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
Oooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free
They was talking "woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion

A week, niggas never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gon' make me take the campers way downtown
You gon' make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture
GCI, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live

We used to roll at the Rink, we used to roll at the Rink
I used to talk way too much, you used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The Rink was the place
But in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, too worried 'bout Frooties and Chews
'Til I found out all the shawdy's with cooties was cute
And realized what booties can do
We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
We ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend

Rolling with your parties

So we gon' have a juke jam
So we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
I'll get close to you
I remember you
You used to "I remember you"
We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe I'm crazy
We never rolled at the Rink
We would just go to the Rink
You ain't buy tokens no more
You just hip roll at the Rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play "Take You Down", Chris Brown
I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing
It's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips
And your legs and my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor
All the kiddies stop skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do
When they grown and they dating
We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe I'm crazy
Crazy about you
We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
We ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend

Rollin with the parties

How great is our God

All will see how great  how great 
How great  how great 
How great, how great, is our God, ohh
The first is that God is better than the world's best thing
God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer
Magnify, magnify, lift it on high
Spit a Spotify to qualify a spot on His side
I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies
Lullabies and alibis, the book don't end with Malachi
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen
'Til one score and three years from the third when he doesn't
My village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins
Shabach barak, edify
Electrify the enemy like Hedwig till he petrified
Any petty Peter Petigrew could get the pesticide, 79th, 79th
I don't believe in science, I believe in signs
Don't believe in signing, I seen dollar signs, color white collar crime
Good God, the gift of freedom
Hosanna Santa invoked and woke up slaves from Southampton to Chatham Manor
My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed
Hear, for I will speak noble things as entrusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, exalt, glorify, descend upon the earth with swords
And fortify the borders where your shortage lie
I used to hide from God, ducked down in the slums like "shhh"
I was lost in the jungle like Simba
After the death of Mufasa, no hog, no meerkat
Hakuna matata by day
But I spent my night time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages
But never got no hear back, or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark to gently, gently
Row my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach
My petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud
Couldn't even let my light shine
But you was always there
When I needed to phone a friend or use a life line
From a lofty height we wage war
On the poltergeist with the exalted Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal, it's tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali will swallow a valley
For every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
O' son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations
With a foot on water and a foot on land?
Who was the angel that rode a Harley
From the project to the house of Parliament
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber
And put the true name of the Lord in it?
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem
Comes like this beast with a ball of fire
They poisoned the scriptures
And gave us the pictures of false messiahs, it was all a lie
Mystery babylon, tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown
Bury my enemies under the ground
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been smoking

Traphouse 3, Guwop

Let me break these bales right down for a second
When it touch down, ooh

I got her breakin' the new rules
She can't be taking no calls
When she involved with a boss
Please don't get lost in the sauce
Please don't get lost in the sauce
She been like this from the door
Told me her mom was a whore
I gave her percs for myself
I give her a perc for esteem
I'm tryna crown me a queen
You hear the chains when they cling
I take the molly its clean
I push the whip with the wings
I gotta be overseas
I gotta be on the pedal
I push it down to the floor
I got designer galore

And in your wake, ripple your sweet fate
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?
Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing

All that never comin' home shit

Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah
Tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Um, trying to think of the right thing to say
When you see them fall down
But you pick 'em up
You still let them touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
Tryna stay light on my toes
Just ran a light in a Rolls
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted
You hit it right on the nose
I'm tired of all of these niggas
I'm tired of all of these hoes
Worried 'bout takin' my lane
They ain't even got on the road
They turn they back and they leave you
They gon' be back when they need you
I practice good over evil
Flippin' the script like a read-through
Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal
I play my part too, like a sequel
You tell your niggas you got 'em on anything
Question is, do they believe you?
'Specially when you never come through
So much hate inside your heart
We don't even know what we done to you
We just know shit gettin' run through
Never chase it, let it come to you
You out here tellin' everybody everything
You niggas move like the one-two, yeah
When you see them fall down
But you pick 'em up
You still let them touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know, they'll know
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?
Hello
I've been hurt so many times
It got to a point
When I decided
I can't do this anymore
I need someone to hold me
I need someone that needs me
I need someone that loves me
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to
You need me to
You know, we don't have to be dramatic
Just romantic
Do all the little things, little things, little things
That excites me
As your woman
Give me a kiss goodnight
Over the phone
When you're working late
When you're out of town
Tell me how much you need this
'Cause we deserve it
We can be together, but
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to 
You need me to

Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying
God knows it
Pure mind and pure soul I possess, he knows it
Anointed and protected, I was chosen
My heart is way too frozen to get broken
I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn their back
On their best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time
I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying
People change, I'm not surprised

Voodoo spells put on my life
It won't work, they all have tried
I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn their back
On their best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time

Gonna have to teach me how to love you again

I'm here to talk about More Life
One second
I'm runnin', but can't run away
You say you changed
But you never change up
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew

On my plate, lookin' up
Outer space, Pearly Gates
I'm runnin', but can't run away
You say you changed
But you never change up
Hermès link, ice-blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga
Yeah, October Firm in the cut
Stay at the top like I'm stuck
That's just how I'm givin' it up
She wanna get married tonight
But I can't take a knee, 'cause I'm wearin' all white
Me and my broski are twins, but we don't look alike
I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that
Muscle relax
That and the spliff put me right on my back, I gotta unpack
Virginia Black
I could go make enough money off that and not even rap
What's that? Facts?
Contract max, I gotta bring that shit back
Hermès link, ice-blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, out of the picture
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my, word to my—
I'm so hot, yeah, I’m so right now
Who's not gang, bitch? Let me find out
Keep hearin' clicks when I'm talkin' on the i
Phone
Feds in the city hate to see us on a high note
I switch flow like I switch time zone
Can't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone
I gotta do mansion 'cause I outgrew condo
Gotta do Maybach, she wanna fuck on the drive home
Yeah, met her once and I got through
I'm never washed, but I'm not new
I know I said top five, but I'm top two
And I'm not two and I got one
Thought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, nah
Hermès link, ice-blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger

Check my account, that's a madness
Check my account, that's a madness 
Block that account, that's a catfish
Block that account, that's a catfish
You don't know me, you better get to know me
Stand up tall, right next to Kobe
A young G, I had the weapon on me
Slice up work like pepperoni 
The police still arrest the homies
No statement, no testimony
Spit in your face with extra bogey
It's my time, I don't flex a Rollie
On cloud 9, a man's extra cozy 
I might switch it up and direct a movie
Pussyholes tried to execute me
Died and came back as Fela Kuti
Don't phone me, send a text to Julie
OVO, man's so unruly
South by, ride out, no Suzuki
Got the Austin Powers, a man's extra groovy 
Front row, jacket tailor-made
Crackhead swag with the razor blade
Red umbrella when I make it rain
My whole team winnin', we don't play your game
Sound like me, but they ain't the same 
See them online tryna fake the fame
They wanna bust jokes, they think I'm Damon Wayans 
It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness 
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish 
Check my account, that's a madness 
Check my account, that's a madness 
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish
Yeah, they're nothin' like me, I'm a fuckin' villain
Go against me, that's a tough decision 
Police wish I was stuck in prison
Fish-eye lens on my tunnel vision 
Real life greaze when I touch the riddim
Still the same guy when I touched a million
Record labels wanted us to listen
But it's greatness only for the love of Britain
I say it how it is and no fucks are given
Greaze, so don't forget to remember me 
Especially all my enemies
Keep your eyes on me with your jealousy
The most solid gang that you will ever see 
Just came back from the embassy
Check my crime sheet, check my legacy
And now I'm back on tour, so what you tellin' me?
 Taliban, Halloween 
Pull up in the whip with the gasoline 
Yeah, that's that boy from the magazine 
Bust my dance at the cash machine
Make her back it up, bounce on my trampoline
Like Martin Luther, man, I had a dream
Now it's my world, you can have the scene
It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish
Check my account, that's a madness
Check my account, that's a madness
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish
Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Yeah
It’s a Habibis ting, ya?
Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic
'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now
Hell nah

We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep
Gettin' loose off the Henny, 'Roc and a hint of Goose
Ocean deep in my swimmin' pool
Throwin' Dead Prez in my livin' room
Takin' shots, feelin' bulletproof
Flood my Rollie, told my bitch: "Let's go snorkelin'!"
Out in Portland, tryna get in her organs
No, I did not sign with Jay
But I still send a Tidal wave
Yeah, I might just go get the fade
Buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
Yeah, it's lit at the crib, you could stay
Me and Drake kick like Kid N' Play
The way that she servin' that cake
I gotta sit back and digest
I guess, for the fuck-shit I'm biased
I mix, double the cup when I stress
Got my momma out the basement
That's a different type of face lift
Free Max B out the bracelets
Don't hit us askin' what the wave is
Hell nah

With, like, some pimpin' to it, or somethin'
That you can relax, pop a top to, or somethin'?
Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me
Or better yet, wait on me
Nah, sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way, nah
Least, do I get an invitation or something?
A statement or something?
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
But here's another nothing that you made into something
Can't just leave it off that way
Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind tonight
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
Yeah, slightly took a left turn there

Slightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me
More ideas and stuff comin'
Yeah, yeah, fam

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, okay, okay, okay
Demon just got out the can 
I gave my bro an advance 
Love is just not in my plans
Not even takin' a chance
Studio right in my yaad
I'm doin' ten in a week
How long I been on this streak?
Dream about work in my sleep 
Okay, I got a lock on the streets
Shoutout to T, he did three
And he brought it in 'cause of me
You don't know nothin' 'bout me
Life for my bruddas is deep
Long as they all on they feet
Long as they pockets is greaze 
I'm in the penthouse but still, nothin' is sweet 
Dust a man down with the pen, it's a sweep 
Taller in person, you'll see when we meet
I heard your new shit and I'm kissin' my teeth
Jheeze!
You know dem ones? Hahaha
Yeah, ahh!
Bringin' that dirty-dirty, bringin' that certy
Mizzy with the quick extension, ringin' off thirty 
I've got bitches in the merky, swervin', lookin' all curvy
And you already know I love them breasts, lookin' all perky
Lookin' all Christmas gift-wrapped, lookin' all turkey
Spen jumped out the Ghost in a suit, lookin' all churchy 
Fingers all itchin', twitchin', lookin' all jerky 
Whippin' that white girl , cookin' that Cersei 
I was pushin' that dark shit, pushin' that charcoal 
Now this is that big bad, this is Gustavo 
Look at them jokers, look at that arsehole
Man are gettin' bread now, and this is that hard dough 
Clap man, dominant murder
I'm a black man, government earner
Could've just slapped man, but he wanted it further 
Batman, da-na-na-da-na
October Firm
I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. 
No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to "Ignition," hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that’s takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone, with the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
This is the 6’s year
Six hundreds instead of six, OVO
You know we’ll be rockin' our asses out
To my big brother Drizzy
You know what I’m sayin'?
More Life, 6 to the world, gang shit
Uh, man, fresh up out the sand, February tan
It's The Boy but I'm still the man
Come and get your mans
I don't know, first you caught the hands
Then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you real—I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen
We with everything, I went off in the '16, give me '17
Want a lot, can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everything
Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down, who's callin' my name?
Who's involved now? Tell me who I gotta down
I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open-ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn
Can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everything
Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein' cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin', always duckin' my release dates
That's when the phone starts ringin' like, "Are we straight?"
Two-faced niggas back around with the three face
Damn, ol' triple double, Russ face
Watch with the bust face
Never-met-the-plug-but-I-rap-about-the-plug face
Never-met-myself, I-don't-remember-who-I-was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up and scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
6 side, East side, all that for my area
You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high.
Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow
You better watch out for me, I'm bound to glow
Your boy all glowed up
Every time we touch down, bet it go up
'Member doin' shows, ain't nobody show up
Pour your heart out, ain't nobody show love
They used to laugh when my whip was on the tow truck
'Til me and bein' broke finally broke up
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
Time to shake the dice, time to change the li-i-ight
No more 9 to 5, autopilot dri-i-ive
Used to work the fries, now we supersi-i-ize
We go suit and tie, we gon' touch the sky-y-y
We so certified, we so certifi-i-ied
Fuck you haters still, that's an F-Y-I-I-I
They gon' bang this here all summerti-i-ime
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
Yeah, yeah
Turn me way up, my voice is really low
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay
 Watch out
Why, nigga?  cops out
 Top down
I started out way down low
Started from the bottom, now we here now
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
We about to get the whole nine
The whole nine, we just landed on a gold mine
We the new Abu Dhabi, this is our time
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
I just take the dreams I've been sold
And sell 'em for more, you already know
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
Hope I deal with karma 'fore my son do
'Cause I be drivin' round this bih with no sunroof
Man, the glow got me feelin' like I'm gunproof
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
I still have my guard up
Blame this thing I'm part of
Tryin' to avoid more confrontation
I just gotta try harder
Takin' the time to clear my mind
'Cause soon as I'm able to let that go
Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow
Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We love y'all too!
We believe if there's anything y'all wanna do in life
You need devotion
Can I hear right on?
Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We live for it
Clap your hands this evening
Come on, y'all
I said it's alright
Clap your hands this evening
Come on, y'allPart I
Yeah
Pool in my eyes
As you beg, I testify that
I hate being alone
But you finally got me out my zone
I know and I miss you
Know when I'm tripping
Oh, yes it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news
Like, "Dun-dun-dun-dun"
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful
We gotta listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you don’t know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you, girl, I know you
Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours
You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a lil' sexual, with you
'Cause I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wave cap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next
Girl, I can't pretend
We gon' have to listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down
I know you, babe
Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours
Yeah, you know already
Tell you what's not yours
Tell you what's not yours
Part II
Six months since I've been back in the Six
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been
I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home, then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
It's weighin' heavy on my mind
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been, babe
R. Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already
Girl, I know you know already

Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down

Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was solid
No, you can't "son" me
You won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach
I reach back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
I don't trust a word you say
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?

Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

Skrrt
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?
Yeah
Nigga, what you thought?
Slatt, slatt, slatt 
Jeffery
Feelin' rough, rough
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'
I wan' beat it up with somethin', somethin'
You're a diamond out the rough or somethin', somethin'
You need to give it up to someone
You need to give love to someone
You need to fuckin' stop watchin' me
You need to give it up to someone
Before you end up like
Woah, woah, woah, woah, like
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah 
Look, I want you to myself
But I know you just left someone else
I know you did, he did a number on you 
That must be why you move so, icy
Icy like 1017
Icy like there's nobody you’d ever need
Better not give that up to anyone but me 
Patient as can be, but
I still need some satisfaction
A little less talk and a little more action
I need you out in Jamaica, relaxin'
Thought I had everything, somehow
Feelin' rough, rough
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'
I wan' beat it up with somethin', somethin'
You're a diamond out the rough or somethin', somethin'
You need to give it up to someone
You need to give love to someone
You need to fuckin' stop watchin' me
You need to give it up to someone
Before you end up like
Woah, woah, woah, woah, like
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah 
I wanna see you do more in this life if we takin' it there 
I want to see you do 911, fuck a Panamera 
See you when I see the real thing 
Gettin' realer and realer, yeah, yeah, yeah
But you icy like 1017 
Icy like there's nobody you'd ever need 
Better not give that up 
I'm here patient as can be, man
I still need some satisfaction
A little less talk and a little more action
I need you out in Jamaica, relaxin'
Thought I had everything somehow
Feelin' rough, rough
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'
I wan' beat it up with somethin', somethin'
You're a diamond out the rough or somethin', somethin'
You need to give it up to someone
You need to give love to someone
You need to fuckin' stop watchin' me
You need to give it up to someone
Before you end up like
Woah, woah, woah, woah, like
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, Jeffery
Yeah
Nigga, what you thought?
Slatt, slatt, slatt
Jeffery 
Jeffery
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah 
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Silence keeps clouding me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered
Yeah, stylin' though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at Silver
City, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin' dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yout when I was writin' Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can’t describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin' up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til morning on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary

It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet and now we're meeting our end
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time 
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A. I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time 
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer
Anytime people want to start problems
It's like “for real, are you dumb?”
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it
Seh feh
Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better
Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line
So they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace
But I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go
I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas "Get it how you can"
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night that I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Make me feel the same way that I did to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side
I said I am....
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the "Are you here?" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit
I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listenin' to things you say
'Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay
Yeah, I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done
I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gonna die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done
One of dem ones—right
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza
Cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, "What are those?"
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk of the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t how it always seems when it’s so together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want—yeah, that's right, yeah
Yeah, I get it
I get it, yeah
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
To feel like she needs me?—I lost my way
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you 
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words
To say to you right now, yeah
Say to you—but 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you—a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim
You know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Damn
I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven
Yeah
I know
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
Yeah, I can't get enough of you, babe
Bottles open up so you can try and open up for me, baby
M.I.A. in the M.I.A
You do you, girl, the haters gon' hate
Cut them off like you a sensei, girl
Oh, I know you feel what I feel
Breaking you off, it's so real
I can't fake that, babe
My love's locked down and you cuffing it
You're the only one I trust with it
You're the only one that stuck with it
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going? Yeah
I'm with you
Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choosey lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
I need you 'round, I need you, oh
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
It's all about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's all about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you, I'm with you
Check, 1-2, 1-2, bitch
You expensive, you know that?
I'm high maintenance a little bit but not in a
Not in a negative way
I just like extremely expensive things
Foot off in their ass is what Ken told me
Niggas like to play games
Cause they feel like they know me 
You don't know me, nigga, I done changed 
So don't be trying to be putting on shit off in the game 
This ain't no motherfucking ninety-one
We out here rapping for money, you niggas rapping for fun
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun
You would think it's all mine the way I took it
You would think it broke down the way I push it
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't?
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
You hit me like "I know you’re there with someone else"
That pussy knows me better than I know myself
On my way from the studio, so get undressed
Let's do the things that we say on text
I want to get straight to the climax 
Have you coming all summer like a season pass
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back
Cause you talk like you got what I need
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze
Talk like you bet it all on me
And you can't take no Ls off me
I know you been—
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
How far we go always seems to get better with time
Won't you, outsmart me
Told me that your brain works better than mine
Tell me I should know you—I'll get to know you again
You want me to show you—I'm gonna show you again
Now we're in the zone—gon' let me all in again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Over and over again, over and over again
Now you're coming over
Over and over again, over and over again
You tell me I should know you—but I'll get to know you again
And you want me to show you—I'm gonna show you again
When were in the zone you—gon' let me own it again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again

How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston?
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son though
Nothing mutual about my funds, 'bout my funds though
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at?
How they feel about you
Where you're from, where your bed at?
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah, I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time though

Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog
Oh and I'm back, dog
Oh, you just went and turned your back, dog
I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though He isn't near me
Based on what I got, it's hard to think that He don't hear me
Hittin' like that 30 on my jersey, man, I'm gifted
Whole lot of sixes but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
6-point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci

Got the key, now the doors open and we all goin' through it

You don't wanna fall in love, I know
I'm not someone you should trust, I know
I give Chanel out like a hug, I know
I knew a couple of your friends way before
How many girls have slept in this bed?
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties, now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag, you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit, I'm getting ready, where you at?
Riding...
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a jungle soldier
Rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier

Thank you, thanks Drake, thanks baby
Motherfuckers drunk and tired
Tired, I'm tired, boss
Dropped outta school now we dumb rich 
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit 
All my niggas wanna do is pop style 
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle 
Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it 
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum 
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got me
They still out to get me, I don't get it
I can not be got, and that's a given
Give a real nigga the number one
Even though I got like twenty-one
Cannot be me I'm a one-of-one
Schooling your ass like 101
They been out here tryna slide on me
They been out here telling lies on me
Everybody looking out for themself
But they still got they eyes on me
See me putting in the hard work now, aye
Momma doesn't have to call work now, aye
I decide when I start work now, aye
Problems hit the gym, they all work out
MVP, MVP, oh-nine all the way to sixteen
Even next season looking like a breeze
Lot of y'all ain't built for the league, yeah
Trade you off the team while you in your sleep, yeah
Y'all showed me that nothing's guaranteed
And you don't know what you started
My friend's chain so big that he look like the artist
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got me
Dropped outta school now we dumb rich 
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit 
All my niggas wanna do is pop style 
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle 
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
Gyal a you mi waan
Pay fi yuh visa meck yo fly out regular
Baby, cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit
Mi wi give you everything weh deh in my wallet
And in my pocket
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit
Mi wi give you everything weh deh in my wallet
And in my pocket
Ooh, baby, yeah
Days in the sun
And nights in the rain
Summer is over, simple and plain
Found me some fun that's good for the pain
Already told you, I don't feel the same
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but show
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know
Dedicate, I dedicate the world
Yeah, oh
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate, oh yeah
I dedicate, I dedicate to you
They throwin' dirt on my old name
Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my sidekick, I just wanna wife
Fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back
And never on the side, yeah
You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it
Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private 
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
Cause we never decided
Tell me how you feel inside
You a real ass woman and I like it, yeah
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it
Yeah, I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say, "A guarantee"
I mean, you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em
Girl, I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive
But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
This song's for you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my voice
This song's for you
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
"It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait"
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city…

Yeezy season approachin'
Fuck whatever y'all been hearin'
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearin'
A monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggas off than Cochran, hah!
On sight, on sight
How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now 'fore you give it up
How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now 'fore you give it up
He'll give us what we need
It may not be what we want
Baby girl tryna get a nut
And her girl tryna give it up
Chopped 'em both down
Don't judge 'em, Joe Brown
One last announcement
No sports bra, let's keep it bouncin'
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the 'Bleau, she tried to sip the fountain
That when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth
On sight, on sight
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Right now
I need right now
For my theme song 
My leather black jeans on 
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom 
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in 
Came to see me in my black skin 
Number one question they're askin'
Fuck every question you askin' 
If I don't get ran out by Catholics 
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go 
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control 
But there's nowhere to go 
And there's no way to slow 
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
Stop all that coon shit 
Early morning cartoon shit 
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch 
Black out the room, bitch 
Stop all that coon shit 
These niggas ain't doin' shit 
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go 
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control 
But there's nowhere to go 
And there's no way to slow 
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

I am a god

Hurry up with my damn massage
Hurry up with my damn ménage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
I am a god
Even though I'm a man of God
My whole life in the hand of God
So y'all better quit playin' with God
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch to give Saint the garment
Until the day I get struck by lightning
I am a god
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
I just talked to Jesus
He said, "What up, Yeezus?"
I said, "Shit I'm chillin'
Tryna stack these millions"

Mi casa, su casa
That's our cosa nostra
I am a god
I am a god

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
Ain't no way I'm givin' up. I'm a god
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin' hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwin' contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw on some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See that's that privately owned prison
Get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
Egyszer a Nap úgy elfáradt
Elaludt mély zöld tó ölén
Az embereknek fájt a sötét
Ő megsajnált, eljött közénk
I can hold my liquor
But this man can’t handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me
Bitch I'm back out my coma
Wakin' up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hangin' on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floatin'
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on your sofa
These the Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch you don't even know us
"Baby girl, he's a loner
Baby girl, he's a loner
Late-night organ donor
After that, he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
When it's over it's over"
And bitch, I'm back out my coma
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Ohhh I wanna phone home
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me
I heard you need a new fad 
I heard you need a new stack 
I heard you need a new phone 
I know your 'rents ain't be home 
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Ohhh I wanna phone home
Damn your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bathwater on
And you turn off your i
Phone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

That's all dem can do

Then she came like AAAAAHHH!

Time to take it too far now
Uh, Michael Douglas out the car now

Uh, but can't wake up from the nightlife
Uh, I'm so scared of my demons
Uh, I go to sleep with a nightlight
Uh, my mind move like a Tron bike
Uh, pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist
Uh, I'm finna start a new movement
Uh, being led by the drums
Uh, I'm a rap-lic priest
Uh, gettin' head by the nuns
Uh, they don't play what I'm playin'
Uh, they don't see what I'm sayin'
Uh, they be ballin' in the D-League
Uh, I be speakin' Swaghili
Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves
I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah I told you to wait
So I'mma need a little more time now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me
All want something out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you not it
So let's get on with it
We could've been somebody
'stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happenin'
You could've been somebody
We could've ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'nolia
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas
I ride with my niggas, I'd die for my...
To all my second string bitches, try and get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyoncé, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #Bad
Bitch
Alert
He Instagram his watch like #Mad
Rich
Alert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That goin' to that owin' money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh, yeah-yeah, she got you homie, yeah
'til death but do your part, unholy matrimony
That summer night holdin' long and long, 'din long
Now waiting for the summer rose and 
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And live and learn
And live and learn
And livin' and livin' like I’m lonely
Lonely, lonely
And livin' all I have
And livin' all
And live
And live
I need to call it off
I need to, I need to make it known
'nother one, something gone
Capricorn

All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan

All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, softer than clay
Maybe it's cause she into Leos and I was into trios
Plus all the trips to Rio couldn't have helped
It's gettin' cold, better bring your ski clothes
Peekin' through the keyhole, the door locked by myself
And I'm feelin' it right now, cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
Blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
Your feelins like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa
On to the next saga
Focus on the future and let the crew knock her
Star Wars fur, yeah, I'm rockin' Chewbacca

Relivin' the past?
Your loss!
Rockstar bitch call me Elvis
M.O.B, she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killin', while I'm drillin'
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night my bitches came in twos
And they both sucked like they came to lose
Dropped out the first day of school
Cause niggas got cocaine to move
I be goin' hard, I got a name to prove
Killin' 'em, honey how I make the pain improve
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
This the cray-ist shit in the club
Since "In Da Club"
It's so packed I might ride around
On my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club
She say "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I say "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evenin' end
When I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin' close to him
Yeezus just rose again
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, no- 
All them other niggas lame, and you know it now
When a real nigga hold you down, you supposed to drown
Bound...
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love
What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking-round-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit
This that red-cup-all-on-the-lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody 
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody 
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Bound
Bound
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love
You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven’t, the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful, blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addictions
Well, gather 'round children, zip it, listen
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
"You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?"
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
 in a Chrysler Le
Baron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Ain’t no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I’m on the edge, so why you playing? I’m saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I’ve foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin’ for the love of ballin’
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won’t be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?
Ain’t no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I’m on the edge, so why you playing? I’m saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I’m in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn’t sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jump shot, running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World’s game, this is my Olympics
We make ‘em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!
Ain’t no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I’m on the edge, so why you playing? I’m saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said “take them glasses off and get in the pool”
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don’t believe in yesterday
And what’s a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I’m sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell ‘em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I’m coming after whoever who has it
I’m coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowin' up, that’s good, fantastic
That y’all, it's like that y'all
I don’t really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls
Ain’t no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I’m on the edge, so why you playing? I’m saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can’t live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly dripping away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I’m living in that 21st Century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the power
The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open
We ain’t got nothing to lose, motherfucker we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I’ll see you in the morning
Huh? I’ll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the power
Till then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my asshole
I’m an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he’s so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn’t open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I’m fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinking
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the powder
Till then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation
Well that’s a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, god damn it I’m killing this shit
I know damn well y’all feeling this shit
I don’t need your pussy, bitch, I’m on my own dick
I ain’t gotta power trip, who you going home with?
How 'Ye doing? I’m surviving
I was drinking earlier, now I’m driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding?
I got the power to make your life so exciting
Now this will be a beautiful death
I’m jumping out the window, I’m letting everything go
I’m letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
I’m jumping out the window, I’m letting everything go
I’m letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
I’m jumping out the window, I’m letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I’m heading home, I’m almost there
I’m on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university
 Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights

Rock life, every night 
Turn up the lights in here, baby

And I'm about to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get
Ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so yeah I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said
"This the number to dial
If you wanna make your #1 your #2 now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?

Whatever I want to do. Gosh! It's cool now

Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?

Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Trying to draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre

But my features and my shows ten times your pay?

Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbiez got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really really I don't give a F-U-C-K

She on a diet but her pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say bride of Chucky is child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me

Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast

Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada

How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?

Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause

Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas

An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more

Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsation
I know I’m preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions, oh she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her make up, she casually allure
Text message break ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it’s rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the Le
Bron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I’m looking at her like this what you really wanted, huh?
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsation
I know I’m preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
When the sun go down it's the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don’t leave while you're hot that’s how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's "Dior Homme", not "Dior, homie"
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me? Could you be more phony?
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsation
Haven’t said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?
Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping Rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speeding, running signs like they don't matter
Uh, hater talking never made me mad
Never that when I'm in my favorite papertag
Therefore G4's at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex sport
So many cars DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was getting mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms
Spinning Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller
I'm making love to the angel of death
Catching feelings never stumble, retracing my steps
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long

Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'mma manage
If one day you just up and leave
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint
Make a nun cum, make her cremate
Move downtown, cop a sweet space
Livin’ life like we won the sweepstakes, what
We headed to hell for heaven’s sakes, huh
Well I’mma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah!
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we’ll live a hell of a life
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams, in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin’ from inside the screen, you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It’s kinda crazy that’s all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we’ll live a hell of a life
One day I’m gon' marry a porn star
We’ll have a big-ass crib and a long yard
We’ll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin’ to hide, we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna role play, 'til I roll over
I’mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja
What party is we goin’ to on Oscar day
'specially if she can’t get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn’t rent her, they couldn’t take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, “Get away”
How could you say they live they life wrong?
When you never fuck with the lights on
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we’ll live a hell of a life
I think I fell in love with a porn star
And got married in a bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That’s one hell of a life
Whose fault?
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call her names, names, I hate you more
Let's call her names, names for sure
On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else"
I took a piss and dismiss it like "fuck it"
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call her names, names, I hate you more
Let's call her names, names for sure
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you
Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1AM and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, "Yeezy, I ain't your right girl"
You'll probably find one of them "I like art"-type girls
All of the lights, she-was-caught-in-the-hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
"Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely" - Chloe Mitchell
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing
Ohh my God
Baby, you done took this shit to another mother fucking level!
Now a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be getting no pussy like this
God damn, God damn!
Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?
You never used to talk dirty, but now you God damn disgusting!
My, my God, where'd you learn that?
Look at you mother fucking butt ass naked...

Who taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on?
Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level!

You done went all porno on a nigga, okay? And I, and I love it...
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!
How did you learn, how... how did your pussy game come up?
I was fucking parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before!
I was in there like "Oh, shit! I never been here before!
I've never even seen this part of pussy town before!"
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit. What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy. And when I see that nigga, I'mma thank him. I'mma buy the album, I'mma download that motherfucker, I'm-a shoot a bootlegger!
That's how good I feel about this nigga
Oww, I still can't believe you got me this watch!
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted!
Even with the bezel! This is the motherfucker I wanted!
I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in The Source!
I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source!
That's right, that's right! Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!
Where you learn to treat a nigga like this?
Yeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you well
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still, down the time
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said she’s down for the night
Slow down the time
I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night
You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Ma ma se, ma ma se, ma ma ku sa
Lost in this plastic life
Let's break out of this fake-ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms, still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each others arms, still get laid, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night

Hey-hey
Us living as we do upside-down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed
To continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often entered vagina
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, free-DOOM
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names
That preceded, the bubblin' bubblin' bubblin' bubblin' bubblin'
In the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
"All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children, and some food to feed them every night"
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
I know you see me now right now

"He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods
That nigga crazy, I told you"
Immature adult, insecure asshole
And if you fall on the concrete, that’s your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan' beat, that’s your last fault
Get what you ask for, I swear that your ass low
She got a big booty, but she couldn’t drop that ass low
'Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow

Ask if I’ma be there soon and tell him I said, “Hell no”
Yo, what you say when your people get out of jail, huh?

'Tention to detail is so uncanny
And the whips on the Sprewells, it’s so un-Camry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferraris
Cute, your shorty watch Barney's, we head to Barneys
End up at Marni, Giorgio, service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic: 32
Lyrically, can’t none of y’all murder Ye
'Cause y’all raps ain’t got no vertebrae
I got style, ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty’s swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin' board when I am bored
All my homies GDs, but I am Lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here’s somethin' that you could use as an analogy
My life is like a child’s illusions become reality
Now go get my throne cause I don’t wanna stop

Americans hate that I'm American
Medicine, I treat it like peppermints
Uh, I'm in the ocean getting shark pussy
Shoot you in your fucking mouth and make you talk to me
Sometimes, I need someone to talk to
'Cause I am not a human being, Part II
Getting paid, show money for walkthroughs
Letting all these hoes ride my dick, carpool
My bars passed the bar exam, no law school
Cash Money Army, veteran with my war wounds
Uh, whatcha man doing?
I pop his muthafucking top like a canned good
And all my niggas that I roll with are hella armed
And last night, I took a transformer
And had a dream that my dick turned to Megatron
But my girl was sleeping with Decepticons
Money talks, man and mine talks lecture-long
P-U-S-S-Y, my second home
I be grinding on them hoes like a half pipe
She say, "Tunechi, you the shit, you need your ass wiped"
I say, "Before you gas me up, check the gas price"
Then I make her take this dick, like advice
She seesaw it, she suck it and enjoy it
I stick it in her ass like some fucking steroids
Jose Canseco, make no mistake
Like a white boy wearing black paint, you're a fake ass nigga
Brake pads, nigga, wait, you ain't in my weight class, nigga
Looking for the mutherfucking man in the mirror
Running this shit like a faucet, Farrah

And I get head while it's decapitated
Think it's a game? Nigga, come play
I'm with my killer B's, fuck bug spray
Yeah, Young Money so gangsta
I personally know strangers
It's so strange, but this girl named Dana like to go anal
Shoot him in his head, what's that? A no-brainer
Plain old nigga, but a break from the norm
I wear my heart on my sleeve, so don't be breaking my arm
I rather ring ya fucking neck before I ring the alarm
I dream to meet a serial killer that'll bring me along with him
I gotta hit 'em like redbones with long hair
Fuck with me, your ass is grass, get a lawn chair
I was fucking before my dick started growing hair
Bitches sweating me like John Mayer, or warm air
Man, nuts and bananas
You know how the tables turn, where are your table manners?
If you fake, put a egg in your shoe and scramble
No rubber, I just fucked this piano

So I give these hoes that work
They say the best things in life are free
That's why it cost for you to get murked
And my pants sagging like fuck it - I'm still on my business
Spent my birthday in jail, I was making bad decisions

She say "Why you asking questions?" I say "Bitch you trynna be funny!"
Now take your fucking clothes off, let me see that Donkey Kong
I swing your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bar

She had cat eyes, nine lives, no tan lines, thigh highs
She ride me like a drive by, I'm real these niggas Sci-Fi
But that's neither here nor there, she been contemplating short hair
She said she tryna be different, but she just like the rest of these bitches
But that's neither here nor there, and my dick is her chair
It be sexual warfare, I be loaded like software
Got so many hoes, I'm hoeing, but she the only one worth knowing
And yeah, I do my dirt, but that's for the flowers to grow in
I ain't tripping, but she be tripping
They ain't got shit on me, but she keep sniffing
Look, girl, just gimme that brain, and I'll return the favor
Them hoes say I'ma dog, but how come I don't chase 'em?
I lick her with no chaser, I pick her out a line up
I just wanted some time, she say, "Okay I'm your honor"
But she been wanting to break up since Dolce and Gabbana
All that ass I just be like, "Come sit your groceries on my counter"
I drink tea, she drink wine, call it Tijuana
I dying to meet her girl, but she want me to meet her momma
Swear I may go Issey Miyake, Bond no. 9
The weed is funky, but I'm smelling fine
Tunechi

Now, I know the only compass that I need

That dick all in your windpipe
Some of her friends I dislike
Some of your friends, they alright
Sometimes I think y'all all dykes
But fuck all that, I'm on one
Don't wanna be with the wrong one
That cold head, that warm tongue
My third leg run marathons
I feel you like I'm blind, girl
Can't you see? It's meant to be
So come to me, then come for me
My game cold, one degree
I'm rolling with two bad bitches 'cause misery loves company
One sweet, one sour, my honeybee and my bumblebee
I miss you in the worst way, ride that dick no speed bumps
No red lights, no stop signs, just get to Lil Tunechi
"Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you
Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you"
Should I call somebody else?
'Cause, girl, it's almost twelve and this dick won't suck itself
Girl, you know it need some help, it'd make a nigga's day
If you said you on your way, eh, eh
Should I call somebody else?
Cuz girl it's almost twelve, and this dick won't suck itself
Girl you know it need some help, it make a nigga's day
I just hope you know the way
And she said

I ain't lookin' back, nigga
I'm a douchebag to these pussy ass niggas
Hammer in my draws but I nail your bitch
Blunts like fingers, I'm bout to make a fist
Everybody die, gon' bury me alive
Grab life by the horns, put the bullshit aside
Glock clip full like the moon in the sky
I'm at the gas station adding fuel to the fire
Life ain't shit but bitches and money
I pass that weed, like I studied
Bury me in fire and watch me phoenix
Highway to Heaven, I'm taking the scenic
You tied to the track of my train of thoughts
And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks
And these hoes wanna kick it with me, I'm a sensei
And I got fat pockets, you niggas in shape
Tools on deck, tattoos on necks
Life is a bitch, I'll make her your ex
Better turn to God 'fore I turn to Godzilla
How the fuck you gon' talk shit to diarrhea
Motherfucker it's on, I'm just rubbing 'em wrong
Put a bug in my ear, but not in my phone
I'll have a broke motherfucker run in your home
For a crumb and a bone

Long hair, don't care, Hacksaw Jim Duggan
Too high to take a breath, too high to take a step
Two rights don't make a wrong, three rights, make a left
The cops on my dick, the feds on my nerves
I walk it like I talk it, got legs on my words
If she don't suck dick, I don't give her that dick
Got the world in my hands, I'mma dribble that bitch
Money is the issue, full court pressure
I like my blunt Nutty Professor
I'mma straight rider with a getaway driver
Hit you dead on the money now you dead on arrival
I don't fuck with these niggas, too old for new friends
But never too rich for new money
These niggas buying Haterade by the twelve pack

Trigger finger itchin', I'll scratch it nigga
Blow your fuckin' brains out in traffic nigga
Got green, New Orleans, St. Patrick nigga

It’s Judgment Day or a fire drill
Yea, I pour out my heart, have a drink
They say the drunk never lie, they ain’t never lyin' yea
My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of kill em all and let em die
God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
The end of time is like a hour away
Damn, military minded, lost and can’t find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I’mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket. Bitch, sit on my rocket
I’m wired out the socket, but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there’s food for thought then I’m guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want – I took heed yea
Now let it breathe, yea
Back to life, back to reality
Been eating my girl and she’s so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what’s appealing to me is under banana trees, love
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain’t that a bitch? I’m just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshener
I don’t play, boy, I ain’t Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
It’s a cold world, I put on a mink
There’s a chain of command, I’m the missing link
God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
And I’m smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet
Here we live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I’mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket. Bitch, sit on my rocket
I’m wired out the socket, but still shockin'
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today ?

Suicide note, suicide doors

Tinted windows bitch, that mean mind yours
And the weed loud, like a lion's roar
Stare into the eyes, the eyes of forever
Hear no evil see no evil, Helen Keller
No music on, rock it acapella
And I don’t need a watch, the time is now or never
Tell my niggas love, I die behind this shit
A nigga counting money, you niggas counterfeit
Real nigga nigga, proud of what I am

If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag

I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

Fear nobody
But God almighty
Shoot that motherfucker 'til I get arthritis
I'm a beast, I'm a ass
I'm ahead of my class
I'm a diamond in the rough
Like a baby in the trash
I don't talk it, I live it
I paint a picture vivid
And them pistols popping
Like they sitting in a skillet
I go so hard, go so mean
I'm so New Orleans
Told the judge
I couldn't budge
It was him or me
Forget the bullshit and remember me
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture!
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation!
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
I'm goin' back in…
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean
Get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
‘Cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals with pride
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard? Gunna
Sleeping at the top, nightmares of the bottom
Everybody wanna be fly until you swat ‘em
But who am I to talk? I ain’t shitting roses
We in the same picture, but we all got different poses
I’m looking in my rearview, I see the world in it
I try to slow down and I get rear-ended
Pause! Like a red light, I’m dead right
Highway to Heaven, God, do you see my headlights?
They say you don’t know what you’re doing 'til you stop doing it
Well, call me clueless 'cause I do this
Attention all shooters, I’m a shooting star
Life is a course, and I'mma shoot for par
I’m searching for today, instead I found tomorrow
And I put that shit right back, like I’ll see what I find tomorrow
Young Money, CMR
Blood like a scar
Weezy F Baby, and the 'F' ain't for flaw
It's like I have it all, but I don't have to worry
Married to the money, a true love story
Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury
Nothing standing in my way like nothing my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me
If I knew I was going to jail I would have fucked my attorney
If you sleeping on me nigga, then I hope you toss and turnin'
I'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask your bitch she will confirm it, yeah
Now where we going with it?
You keep opening your grill, I'm barbecuing with it
I know my shit already tight, so I ain't screwing with it
Some say this game is a joke, well I hope they get it
Okay, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point
Yeah the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice
I'm a gangsta by choice, I hope my sons choose wiser
And don't call me "Sir", call me "Survivor"
Uh, call me killer cause I make a killing
I got this shit wrapped up, bow and a ribbon
That's them twin Glocks, you can call them siblings
And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribblin
I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails
These bitches think they fly, like tinkerbell
But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell
I let them be, cause you know how the sting’ll feel
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
And I fuck up any track, train derail
Know how to roll, never need training wheels
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uh, all or nothing, or nothing else
I bleed reality, I should cut myself
Just had a bowl of riches and a cup of wealth
And the 'F' is for "fuck yourself"
And I ain’t doing nothing but getting my share, breathing this air
And Mack’s mom told me she gon' keep me in her prayers
So I’m feeling alright, I’m trying to stay aware
And if you want to trip, then I'mma meet you there
To my niggas in the game, keep the game fair
Players play, coaches coach, and cheerleaders cheer
I’m trying to keep spirit when the ghost disappear
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' ain’t for fear
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga!"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for me!"
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry, call that "wine and dine"
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say "choose wisely," that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like the asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend, man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches
And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it "Waynes" it pours
No really, I'm on my "fuck that bitch" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches
Coconut Ciroc
Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock
Well, and I wish I never met ya
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not four-ever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, I was working doubles
I wish you the best, good luck boo
Weezy F, for "fuck you"
No ain't nothing going on
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home
Get away from here girl, I'm so glad you're gone
This is the last song I'm writing for you
Now I see how you can be
I don't want you 'round you me all you do is down me girl
How many years I tried to get ya
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya, cause girl done taught me
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches
Carterfornia, Tune
Yeah, it sound like that 'Lil' man
That be, like, Wayne
Right over there
That nigga's from another planet—insanity
Shit, niggas from this planet ain't safe
Hot's what it is, watch what the kid drops
I'mma get the prop if you're not with the biz
Not only other regions, I really popped at the crib
So hatin' motherfuckers, you better stop with the jibs
Off of the thizz, but I'm boss
It don't matter what the cost when I live right across from the Wiz
Killa City will have a nigga lost in the Mid
Doing nothing but mothers stacking pussy coffin again
What is happening is a merger
Different levels of murder
Lil Weezy cook it and I'mma serve her
Further when I'mma get doing this - remember when eating Gerber
Mama said to kill 'em all, and I heard her
Thank you, Baby, for what became Lil Wayne
It's gettin' all the people knowin' that Strange in the game
I been really able to hang in the fame
But when he shouted my name it's been a change in my lane
I'm a Klusterfuk and lovin' nothin' but to get your brain
And I be stuck in lust and quick to a bust a nut
And take a nigga's dame with no shame
When they be bussing 'nough
They thinkin' they thuggin' tough
But never do knuckle up
You in the gang, you bang
You drunk and touching every thang, you lame
Sucka, you cannot sustain the reign
Tech N9ne is such a cuckoo in this
Baller nigga, Strange Music, crew threw swishes
I know a lot of you prolly never knew who this is
Well, you listenin' to Tecca Nina, Soo Woo business
Today, I feel electric gray, I hope tomorrow neon black
I tell a nigga, "All those flows are borrowed"
It’s the pharaoh, Three Stacks
I woke up in Cairo
Lookin’ at stars so bright in the sky, I thought they were marbles
No car doors, whatcha call those?
A whole carload of raw hoes
In a Jeep Defender
Please remember, don’t feed the Simba
Three’s assembled like nobody
He's a symbol of what's safari
Pulled her ponytail to my body
She’s the only girl that was smart E-
-nough to call me 'Mr. Benjamin' in the middle of a wild party
Skin was cinnamon; I pound it harder
How come the only girls that are thought of
Are the light ones?
Well tonight then, we gon’ do it, do it, do it for the dark ones
It’s important that you are more than
Welcome to Tha Carter IV and
Y’all enjoy it, I will go ‘head
And I’ll kiss y’all on y’all forehead, out
Just saw an alien saucer approaching from the sky
Radio contact has been attempted but cannot be established Instructions are to prepare for an attack by an unknown enemy
Fo’ fo’ bulldog: my motherfucking pet
I point it at you and tell that motherfucker "fetch"
I’m fucking her good, she got her legs on my neck
I get pussy, mouth and ass, call that bitch triple threat
When I was in jail she let me call her collect
But if she get greedy, I’ma starve her to death
Top down, it’s upset
Been fucking the world and nigga I ain't cum yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking 'bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepared for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch I got my hand up her dress
The money don’t sleep, so Weezy can’t rest
And AK-47 is my fucking address, huh
I’m not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car, I got a chopper in the car
Load up the choppers like it’s December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I’m talking all brown linen, huh
Big black nigga in a icey watch
Shoes on the coupe, bitch I got a Nike shop
Count the profits you could bring 'em in a Nike box
Grinding in my Jordans kick 'em off they might be hot, swish!
I’m swimming in a yellow bitch in the red 911 looking devilish
Red beam make a bitch nigga sit down
Thought it were bullet proof till he got hit the fifth time
Drop palmolive in a nigga dope
Make it come back even harder than before
Baby I’m the only one that paid your car notes
Well connected got killers off in Chicago
I’m not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car, I got a chopper in the car
Load up the choppers like it’s December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I’m talking all brown linen, huh
Talk stupid, get ya head popped
I got that Esther, bitch I’m Redd Foxx
Big B’s, Red Sox, I get money to kill time, dead clocks
Your fucking with a nigga who won’t give a fuck
Empty the clip then roll the window up
Pussy nigga sweet, them niggas Cinnabon
I’m in a red bitch, she said she finna come
200 thou' on a chain, I don’t need a piece
That banana clip, let Chiquita speak
Dark shades, Eazy E, five letters, YMCMB
Bitch ass nigga, pussy ass nigga
I see ya looking, with ya looking ass nigga
You know the rules, kill them all and keep moving
If I died today it’d be a holiday
I’m not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car, so don’t make it come alive
Rip yo ass apart then I pull myself together
YMCMB, double M, we rich forever
The bigger the bullet the more that bitch gon' bang
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint
Red Lamborghini till I gave it to my bitch
My first home invasion, papi gave me 40 bricks
Son of a bitch, then I made a great escape
Ain't it funny mom her only son be baking cakes
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I’m Santa Claus
Niggas gather round, got gifts for each and all of y’all
Take it home and let it bubble that's the double up
If you get in trouble that just mean you fucking up
It’s a cold World I need a bird to cuddle up
I call the plays, motherfucker huddle up
I’m not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car, I got a chopper in the car
I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker
I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking 'bout abortion
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli
He says he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said "You's an ill nigga"
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on I Don't Give a Fuck Avenue
 + 
 Down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble better check the point spread
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Smoking on that hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Life is a roller coaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there
Oohh, ooh
So special, you're so special
So special, you're so special
Oohh, ooh
So special, you're so special
So special, you're so special
Uh, boy shorts, wife beater
Now let me see it, I'm a sightseer
She was sleeping on me, but she's a light sleeper
I make her cum first, then I follow the leader
I talk shit, I hope it matters
We climax, without the ladder
Can't desert the future, no Nevada
Her body is a weapon, ratatat her
I spent the night in heaven, I slept with an angel
And when we finish, I swear that pussy said thank you
I said, "You're Very Welcome" I'm so well mannered
And I go down south, Louisiana
Baby won't you spend the night
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'mma make you feel so special girl
Then we take a shower together, and wash each others back
And if she kick it off, I'ma run it back
And then she say my name, like I forgot it
She crazy about that dick, Lorena Bobbitt
Love be the pilot, but it's kamikaze
Yeah, body language, girl let's talk about it
Freedom of speech, Weezy a beast
Open her up like a book, read it and weep
Baby won't you spend the night
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'mma make you feel so special girl
Yeah, thinking bout you girl got my mind on E
You know them other niggas ain't me
Girl I got that 12 play for ya, that 12 play for ya
Just sit on my grill, that's that tailgate for ya
I, put it together, common denominator
I tear it up like loose leaf paper
I got drinks on chill, my bedroom huge
I knock her lights out, I blow her fuse
See we don't even fuck no more, we make love
And now shes on the tip of my tongue, my taste buds
Cause she my honey bee, yeah, buzz buzz
And now I'm itching and scratching, that's that love bug
Baby won't you spend the night
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'mma make you feel so special girl
Cut the music up
A little louder..
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love
When you was just a young’un, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
See You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck
Couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck
Couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love
See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual
You see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck
Couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck
Couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
God bless america...
- Carter, are you prepared to take the constitutional oath?
- I am...
- Will you place your left hand on the Bible and raise your right hand and repeat after me, I...
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can
Money on my mind as God as my witness
Love don't live here and it don't even visit
I do this for my Uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pot to piss in
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em
Uh, I'm a monster, exorcisms
Tote tools like mechanics, mechanisms
Uh, detrimental on any instrumental
I say you rappers sweet I pay the incidentals
I'm beneficial, I've been official
I say you rappers sweet, tiramisu
I like my short cake shorter
Ain't no motherfucker harder than
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
Nobody gives you a chance, you gotta take chances
Your family tree, I will break branches
Cause I don't give a fuck, I put the ass in assassin
Smoke you like a blunt then it's ashes to ashes
The future is born, put the past in the casket
If real shit is dead then nigga I'm a bastard
Uh, appetite for disaster
I want a full plate then another plate after
Uh, yesterday just died
Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives
When shit get deep I'm never afraid to dive
Let the money pile up until I'm buried alive
Ask who the fuck want it, I bring it to your doorbell
Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale
Smoking weed, getting head in the oval office
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses
Amen, so now instead of pledge, we pray, yeah
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
Ya dead to me, brown grass nigga
I just stand still and let the ground pass nigga
Bullshit for lunch, brown bag nigga
Reality’s a bitch and I'mma dance with her
140 pounds, 5'6 from the ground
Bitch I'm in the building you ain't even in the lounge
I tried to fuck the world and couldn't even get aroused
I ain't looking for the beef but I ain't seen it in a while
Uh, and we all want world peace
Murder show, I give your ass good seats
Shit, I'm much more than a good speech
Gorillas in suits
The holy war, the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth
Drowning in the political soup
They shoot missiles and nukes
Taking out such a pivotal group
The body count is the physical proof
And they thought drugs were killing the youth, *chuckles*
Thank you, thank you all, I am President Carter
You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a king on his throne
When you’re chained in the dark all alone?
I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushing the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargaining on cocaine
So in other words nigga, do your thing
Mind in one place heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he’s just angry at you niggas
Who dont have your heart in your rap shit and got too fuckin comfy
Cause we still fuckin hungry, Young Money, got the munchies
Faded, fuckin faded, aww yeah I'm fuckin faded
They tellin’ lies about me, aww yeah I must've made it
Rikers Island on this flow, 8 months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole
Three visits later, I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out
Stop playin, I ain't with that bullshit
Niggas act like bitches, shanaynay, oh my goodness
This is Wayne’s world, and y’all are just some tourists
Give me three wishes, I wish, I wish, I wish, you would bitch
Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby powder
Two Glock 40′s, nigga you got 80 problems
Swimmin’ in the money, I'mma need some fuckin goggles
It's better to give, but we don't give a fuck about 'em
I just came home, shit done got real, ho
Lil Weezy-ana, the boot nigga, steel toe
I ain't workin with a full deck but I deal ho
I just touched down, kick the motherfucking field goal
Talkin ’bout baby money? I got your baby money
Kidnap your bitch, get that "how-much-you-love-your-lady" money
I know you fake nigga, press your brakes nigga
I’ll take you out, that’s a date nigga
I'm a grown ass blood, stop playin with me
Play asshole and get an ass whippin’
I think you pussy cat, ha, hello kitty
I just throw the alley-oop to Drake Griffin
I lay 'em down, tempur-pedic
This shits a game of chess, you niggas think it's cleavage
Its Young Money, yeah, tis the season
I give you the business, bitch this a business meeting
My niggas hungry, my bitches greedy
Will I die a bloody murder? Dear Mr. Ouija
Nigga, I'm straight, my girl a faggot
Potato on the barrel, pop pop potato salad
Yeah, when I step in the spot, motherfuckers say "who that?"
Big Bun B, but you already knew that
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
You hatin' on the trill OG, where they do that? 
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix man, just go' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand, with no easy fix, man
No tricks, man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar, and hoes in the crib
Drank, and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with PA so you know what it is
I'm sittin on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
And we do it for the pimps no holding back, let's go!
Look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB till the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants like Kanye West and Em
Track record, goes back to the Essence
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man's intestines
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
Gut 'em like a gastric bypass
But ya Nas advocates actors seemed to get typecast in the same role
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow
Cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it's Chandon
Fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden
I was real young little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs
That'll bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight that my crown ain't for testin', testin'
Chop heads off like King Henry VIII
Guillotine to ya neck bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin' dude
Studied cowards and made power moves
Watched Wild Planet seen lions devour food
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
There go my nigga Wayne
Let them niggas hate or like my nigga Drake say
"We ain't got time to respond to niggas"
I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta, when I pop up with them poppers burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa, Blood gang, five
It’s that Blood gang five, but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain’t gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain’t gon' fight
They actin' like they ain’t gon' die until I let them 'llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed-do-or-die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it’s no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it’s the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!
They say I’m underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That’s when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin' “there he goes again!"
See now they nominated a nigga to come and
Flatten everything now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain’t no fakin’, ain’t no kind of mistakin' how I be breakin'
Up everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I’m done 
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?
Okay, now enough of that, see now I’m out the door
Tunechi, thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic with tha Carter IV
I stepped on a flower, foot on a petal
Good wasn't home so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like "Hey, I like the view from here!"
I'm so high I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
All these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy and problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho
God bless the world, and most people in it
It's anybody's game, but nobody's winning
Mona Lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish
We wen't from Boyz to Menace, Menace II Society
Now we get higher, call that shit karate
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side
Yeah, I got a pussy hangover
Bitches eat me up like my name is Russell Stover
Murder the perception, make 'em get it right
If I'm flirting with perfection, I'm fucking tonight
I'm a Southerner delight, Louisiana pride
The belly of the beast, it ate me alive
Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive
And today, I took a walk outside and...
Uh, and we all kiss our mamas
Cuz promises are broken but tomorrow isn't promised
Think I'm gettin' sick, I'm feelin' illegal
And not having money is the root of all evil
Life is a midget, so try to live it up
It's Dr. Carter, bitch, I got this shit nipped and tucked
If these walls could talk, they probably won't shut up
I need some wallpaper before they start to fuss
Yea, pick up the phone and call your bluff
Human growth hormone, now my pockets all buff
I don't think about the future, it comes soon enough
Motherfucker I don't shoot ya, bitch I shoot ya up
I ain't like these niggas, I don't like these niggas
I just roll another joint like Spike Lee nigga
And I woke up this morning, got the coal out my eyes
And then I took a walk outside and...
With everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going
But you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it
Look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the..
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again
I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see that guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin' at the..
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again
Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in the broken mirror
I see my mama smile that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message coulda been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the..
MJ taught me that
Take 'em to Mars, man
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again
Hey B.P., looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time?
So why are we, talking to each other again...
Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
It's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser
Goons in this bitch, leave a nigga on a stretcher
It's all there papa, you ain't even got to measure
Laughing at how my old bitches look jealous
Well what goes around comes around, propellers
Money Over Bitches, M.O.B, goodfellas
Cut our ears off, ain't shit you could tell us
Write your name on the bullet, that's a fuckin' love letter
If I ain't a trendin' topic, I'm a fuckin' trend-setter, I'm on
Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
It's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser
If you're scared, go to church, Mason Betha
Sometimes the paper chase could be like chasin' a leopard
The pussy wetter, wetter than it's ever been
But she gone probably try to cross the line like a Mexican
I ain't on that bullshit, shorty fine as fuck though
Now she kiss me on my neck, I hope she ain't cut-throat
Cut down on the syrup cause it made me fuck slow
Shoot so many times I'mma choke off the gunsmoke
Life, death, love, hate, pleasure, pain
Pay me no mind but I don't have change
I cock back and aim at your membrane
Broad day, no mask, close range
You can get two shots from wherever, two shots from whoever
It be like a puzzle tryna put you back together
I should probably do better but probably, whatever
Your bullshit is stinkin' up the place
Me no tek bad up, me a done de place
Can't let these bitch niggas slide and touch base
I make her cum so many times, call her "nutcase"
It's Young Money baby, take your clothes off
Give me them three holes, bowlin' ball
Two shots of whatever
Keep them bitches cummin' and she gon' do whatever
Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
It's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser
Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
Up up and away
I'm about to go, up up and away
Dick in your mouth, fuck what you say
You sweet as pie, a muffin or cake
Dick in her mouth, I'm fuckin' her face
Live for the night, sleep in the day
Get high as fuck, sleep it away
I am a dog, you sheep in the gate
Pussy, umh? How sweet is the taste
Gun to your head, what you keep in the safe?
Weezy bitch, I'm deep into space
Floating away like a leaf on the lake
I'm gone like, delete and erase
Talk that shit, I walk that shit
Pills, weed, all that shit
If the bitch is bad, I'mma call that bitch
Get pussy, ass, all that shit
Umh, what they talking about?
I go hard, they soft as a couch
I'm running 'em in and walking 'em out
Cars so cold I parked in the house
Flows so raw, this beat is pregnant
Flow so tight, it's yeast infected
Kill 'em all when they least expect it
Money tall, Lisa Leslie
YMCMB connection
Rappers is what I eat for breakfast
Woman up in my sheets is sexy
If she ain't fucking, she can exit
Gun tucked in the waist, I bust in ya face
I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days
Weezy  Where ya going? 
You're going a little bit too far
Ain't this a bitch
I just saw my bitch kiss a bitch
You're lucky I don't kill your ass
But you can still get pistol whipped
Sharper than a pencil tip
Bitch don't even fix your lip
40 cal' with the extended clip
Ain't gon' be no incident
Skinny jeans, red Vans
Skully on, money long
Her mouth is like my house
So I guess you can say I'm coming home
You're wyling out then we're riding out
Now your hiding out, honeycomb
I'm laughing to the bank
Like I just broke my fucking funny bone
What's really good five?
I'm over here smoking that really good fire
Eyes so low I look blind
But the stove on my waist cook fine
I be with niggas that took lives
And niggas that'll take it outside
And niggas that'll take it to your crib
Take the baby out the crib and rape housewives
I'm gon' get so wasted
They gon' have to carry me out this bitch
I took over this rap shit
These rappers are just my hostages
Let's cut to the chase, my bitch no habla ingles
But I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away
Weezy  Where ya going?
You're going a little bit too far 
Fuck with a nigga, if you fuck with a nigga
Fuck with me, good luck to the nigga
Straps on deck, so fuck that nigga
Leave you looking like lightning struck that nigga
Racks on deck, I'm rich as shit
I'm calling my bitch the shit
Walking around on my fuck it shit
I done did everything on my bucket list
Fuck that shit, I'm Superbad
I don't give a Hoover damn
Man, I son all these niggas
They should have a stupid tan
Ha, President Carter, vote for Lil Wayne
Sit your five dollar ass down 'fore I make change
I'm pumping your brakes, I'm jumping the gates
And I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away
Weezy, where ya going?
You're going a little bit too far 
Raindrops from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds do fly
Ooh girl, I love you so
Good lord almighty, I’m in love with a whitey
I call her Aphrodite, I call her when I need her
And she give me good love til my nose start bleeding
Life is just like moving mountains
When I can’t cope, I’m hittin’ that slope
That great white hope, and it ain't no pressure
I can’t feel nothing, but I never felt better
Hmm, but you were just no good for me
Killin’ me softly, that girl is poison
Huh, I had to let you go, take things slow
Just so you know
I’ll do it all again if I had the chance
Don’t feel the pain 
Like novacane 
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong
Don’t feel the pain 
Like novacane 
Like novacane
You used to make me feel so good
Like I was on top of the World
Sorry I gotta stay away from ya
But that's what the doctor prefered
My Friends told me leave you alone
And I just told 'em leave me alone
It's sad our thing had to end
The relationship was short and sweet, Nia Long
And I see her in the streets
But I can't bring her home
Man, I was on her line all day, no phone
Hah. No Arm & Hammer in my Tony Montana
And truth is...
Sweet sugar hill, yeah I used to climb her
I never imagined she'd turn out to be but a cheap thrill
That sweet turned to sour, she gave me power
The world was ours
I used to feel invincible on that flour
But I had to change, Yeah, I had to change
So I left it for a bitch named Mary Jane
Now everything's cool, everything's fine
Girl, I'm moving on, I left you behind
Every now and then you pop up on my mind

You decide
Are we gonna live or die?
So I was takin' a walk the other day, and I seen a woman—a blind woman—pacin' up and down the sidewalk. She seemed to be a bit frustrated, as if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it. So after watchin' her struggle for a while, I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know? "Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance? It seems to me that you have lost something. I would like to help you find it." She replied: "Oh yes, you have lost something. You've lost... your life."
{Gunshot}
Is it wickedness?
Lamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song, quote: "And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'…"
Oh please, ugh, I don't like it.
I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born onside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on-sale motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to, antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder — these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder — our DNA
DNA
Gimme some ganja, gimme some ganja

Ain't no ho inside my DNA
Drippin' gold inside my DNA
Power shows inside my DNA

Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists

Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me

Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music, though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' what 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts our logic
I feel like say somethin', I feel like take somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin'
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up 
All I want tonight is just to get high up 
Girl, you look so good, it's to die for 
Ooh, that pussy good, it's to die for 
It's a secret society
All we ask is trust
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
Bad girl Ri
Ri now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, leave it now
On your pulse like it's EDM
Gas in the bitch like it's premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established
Hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I'm a natural, I'm alright
I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I'm a king
Shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy ya rock 
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside 
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long lost hope
I done came down so hard I slowed
Honestly forever, all a real nigga want
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up 
All I want tonight is just to get high up 
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? 
Do it end with your family and friends? 
Or you're loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up 
All I want tonight is just to get high up
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
Lord knows I'm tryin'
Lord knows I'm dyin', baby
Love's gonna get you killed
But pride's gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and—
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love 'em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in men
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make amend
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I'm willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
Pity parties and functions and you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what Winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Wicked or weakness?
You gotta see this
Waaaaay 
Nobody pray for me
It's been that day for me
Waaaaay 
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact, I'm downin' this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman 
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in, if it's okay
She said, "It's okay."
Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
This that new shit
This that new, new shit
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you—

Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with your homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doin', just make it count
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count

I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in the trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life!
Manager called, the lobby called, it's 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways; Lust
Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately, my lust been heightened 
Lately, it’s all contradiction
Lately, I’m not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately, in James 4:4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself, lust is all yours
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too high to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in, if it's okay
She said, "It's okay."
Damn, love or lust
Damn, all of us
We still lettin' it spin, y'all

New Kung Fu Kenny
Throw a steak off the ark
To a pool full of sharks, he'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness
With a sworn nemesis, he'll make it
Take the gratitude from him
I bet he'll show you somethin', whoa
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
X-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' 
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me?
It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I'll wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my mama
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back—
Alright, kids, we're gonna talk about gun control
 Damn!
 It's not a place
This country is to me a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around
Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us!
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets
Wall Street, corporate offices
Banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to blood?
I'll ask again — oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does
It's not a place
This country is to me a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look ar—
Poverty's paradise
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
I've been hungry all my life
What's up, family? Yeah, it's yo cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man. I know you been havin' a lot on yo mind lately, and I know you feel like, you know, people ain't been prayin' for you. But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people. Deuteronomy 28:28 says, "The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart." See, family, that's why you feel like you feel like you got a chip on your shoulder. Until you finally get the memo, you will always feel that way…
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won't you burn this muh'fucka?
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
I beat yo ass, keep talkin' back
I beat yo ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo ass, lil nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo ass if I beat yo ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
I'll prolly die anonymous
I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I've been hungry all my life
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
Now…
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn
Goddamn you
Goddamn me
Goddamn us
Goddamn we
Goddamn us all
Verse two says, "You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities." So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments, we're gonna feel this way, we're gonna be under this curse. Because He said He's gonna punish us, the so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians, are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites, according to the Bible. The children of Israel, He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods that aren't His son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee. So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chastise you because He loves you. So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in. Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments, and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us. We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today, in the United States of America. I love you, son, and I pray for you. God bless you, shalom.
This what God feel like, huh, yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah

Don't judge! Don't judge me!
Now my home got a Valley peak
Don't judge me, if I press your line you a freak
Don't judge me, won't you tell a friend y'all gon' see—

Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cause, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel
I don't rush shit, fuck shit
Always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit
Morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Ask for a piece of mine, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit
Levitatin', duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous
This what God feel like
Huh, yeah 
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!"
Huh, yeah 
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!"
Huh, yeah 
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, yeah 
This what God feel like
It was always me vs the world
Until I found it's me vs me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
We gon' put it in reverse
Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—
Oh Lamar, Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, Momma on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin'
But witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works
Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didn't kill him; in fact, it look like they're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight
{Gunshot}
{Reversed Audio}
So, I was takin' a walk the other day…
Every nigger is a star, ay, every nigger is a star
Every nigger is a star, ay, every nigger is a star
Every nigger is a star, ay
Who will deny that you and I and every nigger is a star?
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You’ll slip through the cracks hopin' that you’ll survive
Gather your wit, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?
When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the prez with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that
We should've never gave
We should've never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should've never gave
We should've never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
At first, I did love you 
But now I just wanna fuck 
Late nights thinkin' of you 
Until I get my nut 
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board 
Destroyed, but what for?
Yo, what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker
What you want? You a house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind 
Don't have receipts 
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché, then say, "Fuck your haters"
I can see the borrow in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop 
Lookin' good when you're on top 
You got a medal for us
Leavin' miracles metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind
We should've never gave
We should've never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should've never gave
We should've never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
Tax man comin', tax man comin'
Tax man comin', tax man comin'
Tax man comin', tax man comin'
Tax man comin', tax man comin'
Fuck you, motherfucker, you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga, you ain't shit Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga, you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty-eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway
I need a baller-ass, boss-ass nigga
You's a off-brand-ass nigga, everybody know it
Your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know
Fuck you, nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the fuck is really going on?
This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made ends meet
Eatin' your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents?
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pit bull
Bullshit, matador, matador
Had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty; apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact, it's nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is in more shit?
Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton and made you rich
Now my dick ain't free
I'mma get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up
You ain't no king
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad , but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
 Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghost writer?
What the fuck happened? 
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell
Something's in the water 
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
 Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7, 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… 
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
 Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton!"
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo!
Ah yeah, fuck the judge, I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king
Bitch, where was you when I was walkin'—
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
 Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where was you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
We want the funk
We want the funk
We want the funk
We want the funk
We want the funk
We want the funk
We want the funk
We want the funk
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit
Hol' up, get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Who ever thought?
Master, take the chains off me!
Zoom Zoom Zoom Zoom Zoom
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom
Zoom Zoom Zoom Zoom Zoom
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom
Shit
Life to me, like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artists like the harvests
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five foot something, God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said
Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin' wit a flashy wrist
My defense, mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well, that's me at these awards
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said...
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
Sex
She just want to close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls, say hey , say hey 
Everyone deserves a night to play 
And she plays only when you tell her no
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved, I’d rather diss 'em
I’d rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon’ crush
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me"
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fucking on a famous rapper
Walls could talk
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need you!
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you
Made you more complacent
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it
I swear—
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100° proof
I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too
House keeping
House keeping
¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
¡Disculpe!
You the reason why mama and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love them
I know you don't mean it
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, you can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence?
Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple
You ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit
Or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas?
On the road, bottles and bitches
You Face
Timed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even Face
Timed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he would recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, "You fuckin' failed"
You ain't try
I know your secrets, nigga
Mood swings is frequent, nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I seen it and you're the reason, nigga
And if this bottle could talk *gulp* I cry myself to sleep
Bitch, everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets, don't let me tell them to the world
About that shit you thinkin' and that time you *gulp* I'm 'bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Should've killed yo' ass a long time ago
You should've feeled that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if those mirrors could talk it would say, "You gotta go"
And if I told your secrets
The world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I...
Hard times like, "God!"
Bad trips like, "Yeah!"
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie, you fucked up
But if God got us, then we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma comin' heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
What you want you: a house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all
Pick back and chat, I trap the back for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid, a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh, ohh
What's wrong, nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta
I thought this what you wanted
They say if you scared, go to church
But remember, he knows the Bible too
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I 
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I 
I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I 
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said, "You crazy?"
Roses are red, violets are blue
But me and you both pushing up daisies if I 
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
You said to me
You said your name was Lucy
I said, "Where's Ricardo?"
You said, "Oh, no, not the show"
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, "Oh, shit"
You said to me
I remember what you said too, you said
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick
You introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this
But I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries
Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty
Avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute
Lucy work harder
Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy
I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract if that’s possible"
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I 
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I 
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home
Oh shit!
I need that
I need that sloppy
That sloppy
Like a Chevy in quicksand
Yeah, that sloppy
This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap
We don't share the same synonym, fall back
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack
My innocence limited the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin', scratchin' dilligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home
We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
I know everything
I know everything, know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious
I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes, and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery
I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
I know you know that line's for Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip 'bout how it was distributed
I know how people work
I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it’s worth
I know what I know and I know it well not to ever forget
Until I realized I didn’t know shit
The day I came home
We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile
Hand-me-down sneakers bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads, exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin' new laws, mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said, "Kendrick, you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh, I forgot, 'Don't Kill My Vibe', that's right, you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken
But never mind, you're here right now, don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor
Make a new list of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit, I mean, your life is full of turmoil
Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
But if you pick destiny over rest in peace then be an advocate
Tell your homies especially to come back home"
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
I been lookin' for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something got me losing my mind, ah!
You make me wanna jump
I been lookin' for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something think I'm losing my mind, ah!
I say where you at, from the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you I react, only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 Special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal any day
I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is...
K-Dot, pick up the phone, nigga
Every time I call, it's going to voicemail
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga?
No socks and skinny jeans and shit, ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha hahah
Call me on Shaniqua's phone!
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies
I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
My lil homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, your shit is where it's at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game, your hood your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them Benjamins go cuddle up
Skip, hop, drip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this"
Thats what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies
Hopped out the Caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called and said, "the enemies done cliqued up"
Oh, yeah? "Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?"
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas names on paper, you snitched all summer
Streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress, set trippin’ all around
Ain't nothin' new, but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-licans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin'?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom, they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it do?"
Obama say, "What it do?"
Obama say, "What it do?"
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies
Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin'
Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y’all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don’t ask about no camera blocking at award shows
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my Vogues
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box?”
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting
A continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
"20 on pump 6," dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend all my ear or two
How to stack these residuals tenfold
The liberal concept of what men'll do
"20 on 6," he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, "Beat it"
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more"
I told him "I ain't have it" and closed my door
Tell me how much a dollar cost
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe
He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
"Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need
Tell me how much a dollar cost"
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe
Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'mma tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet"
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep"
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss. I am God"
I washed my hands, I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what it's all meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change to right my wrongs
Complexion 
Complexion don't mean a thing 
Complexion 
It all feels the same 
Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak 
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention
Complexion 
Complexion don't mean a thing 
Complexion 
It all feels the same 
Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak 
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'ma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then Whit told me, "A woman is woman, love the creation"
It all came from God, then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...
Complexion 
Complexion don't mean a thing 
Complexion 
It all feels the same 
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2Pac
Keep your head up, when did you stop loving thy
Color of your skin? Color of your eyes
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don’t mean you smart, bein' dark don’t make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin' “Woo-hah!”
Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored
Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain’t complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain’t no stress, jiggaboos wanna be
I ain’t talkin' Jay, I ain’t talkin' Bey
I’m talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens
And spike your self esteem
The new James Bond gon' be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it’s all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain’t a thing
Barefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car?
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth
Everything black, I don't want black 
I want everything black, I ain't need black 
Some white, some black, I ain't mean black 
I want everything black 
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black
Six in the morn', fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn, that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me
Black don't crack, my nigga
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street when gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!
Study long, study wrong, nigga
Hey, y'all close that front door, ya'll let flies in this motherfucker
Close that door!
My OG up in this motherfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle of Hennessy in his hand, actin' a fool
Hey, hey, babe check it out, Imma tell you what my mama had said, she like:
I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk, we know that it's all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name
Askin' "where the hoes at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the moneybags?" to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
And the world don't respect you
And the culture don't accept you
But you think it's all love
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
Repetition can't protect you if you never had one
Jealousy , emotional 
Self-pity , under oath 
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
Let me put it back in proper context
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
Askin' "where the hoes at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the moneybags?" to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie
What do you got to offer?
Tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin', been a virgin to bullshit
And sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazi, bitches be fugazi
This is for fugazi niggas and bitches who make habitual lyin' babies, bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
Or you, the truth you love to bend
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though
So loud, rich niggas got low money
And loud, broke niggas got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel:
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
Is this mic on? 
Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
We're bringing up nobody, nobody...
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
He done traveled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All of the little boys and girls, come up here
Come right here, this is for you, come on up
Kendrick Lamar, make some noise, brother
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
And 
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
One day at a time, tryna go shine
They wanna say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme uh
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation 
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker I smile
And 
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
One day at a time, uhh
Lift up your head and keep moving,  turn the mic up
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga
And 
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
Huh  huh 
Huh  huh 
 huh  huh 
 huh  one, two, three
 And 
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
One day at a time, uhh
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'mma do it till I get it right
I went to war last night 
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body...
Not on my time, Not while I'm up here
Not on my time, kill the music
Not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
We could save that shit, this for the kids bro
2015, niggas tired of playin' victim dog
Niggas ain't trying to play vic— Tu
Tu, how many niggas we done lost?
Yan-Yan, how many we done lost?
No for real, answer the question, how many niggas we done lost bro?
This, this year alone
Exactly. So we ain't got time to waste time my nigga
Niggas gotta make time bro
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time right?
The judge make time so it ain’t shit
It shouldn’t be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dawg
On the dead homies. Charlie P, you know that bro
You know that
It’s mando. Right, it's mando
And I say this because I love you niggas man
I love all my niggas bro
Exac- enough said, enough said
We gon' get back to the show and move on, because that shit petty my nigga
Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to-
All my niggas listen
Listen to this:
I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga"
He said, "Think about what you saying: 'Fuck niggas'
No better than Samuel on Django
No better than a white man with slave boats"
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; King royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: Black emperor, King, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlook the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me
Or say no more. Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan 
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing
But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that
Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon’ stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?
You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalised without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time?
Like who got your best interest?
Like how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge or your mind when it’s mentioned?
You wanna love like Nelson,  you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes but you peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
Let my word be your Earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga
I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you
That’s not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben’s Island analysing, that’s where his cell is
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow
Murphy’s Law, generation X, will I ever be your X?
Floss off a baby step, mauled by the mouth of
Pit bulls, put me under stress
Crawled under rocks, ducking y’all, it’s respect
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead?
Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shoot or you assassin
Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it’s Michael Jackson, oh
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us "Billie Jean", you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga
"I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man, maybe I’m just another nigga”
Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own but it's looking like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really going off, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh
I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
Who could of predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip blogs want to cover me
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could of been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good
All in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh
Everything's the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh
Things have been so crazy and hectic
I shoulda gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help
Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
And tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere
That had somebody that you know
I'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone
In that place you call your home
Warm nights and cold Patron
I hope that you don't get known for nothing crazy
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose
Yesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you woulda liked it
I, I, I know you all too well
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited
There's no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty here I go
Should I spend a weekend in Vegas?
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it
I mean, how could I forget?
My memory's never faded
I can't relate to these haters
My enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit
Carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist
And that's how she met my pops
And now my garden is enormous
"It's happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!"
I avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead
Uh-huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say "You promised me you would never change"
"You promised me you would never change"
Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on?
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on, now that I'm on
I don't really want to worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit "redial", you'll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texted saying she wished she would have kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread
It's like I'm high right now, the guy right now
And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
Cause we just having the time of our lives right now
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say "You promised me you would never change"
"You promised me you would never change"
I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I started treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe cause a girl I thought I trusted
Was who set the whole shit up
But in fact I haven't seen them since they locked Big Rich up
I know but same time I'm quick to forget
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?
Yeah, I just need some closure
Ain't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over
Young Money
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'mma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch: Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
"Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me neither"
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'mma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me
I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'mma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'mma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'mma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby
Show me a good time 
Show me a good time 
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time 
I live for the nights that I can't remember
With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money that I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I won't regret
I've been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Telling everybody that I know we about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't trying to look like I lied to these niggas
That I came up with, that's my team
Never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan, niggas want that cream
I'm the Osiris to this shit right now
Go-to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl, pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor, better quit right now
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby
Show me a good time 
Show me a good time 
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time 
How about you and all your morals
In that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight
And worry bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl
Can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne
Presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg?
People really hate it when a backpack rapper
Get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do it if they could
It's in our nature—young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground though
So I'mma spend another $10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch, I made it—Yup!
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby
Show me a good time 
Show me a good time 
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time 
Kush rolled, glass full: I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm havin' a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying "you should quit", cars saying "fuck your life"
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww
Drizzy say get her, I'mma get her
I got the kind of money, that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda—wait, wait—fixate
Which bitch, you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake, bought the president
The Louis presidential briefcase, never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks, I ain't talkin' about the Peach State
Man, for Pete's sake, scratch that—sweepstakes
 Fuck I look like, ho?
I look like "yes" and you like "no"
I'm a bad bitch, I ain't never been a mixed breed
On a diet, but I'm doin' donuts in a 6-speed
M6 in front of M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on the menu
But I collect 100 thou' at the venue
And pop bottles with my team, Young Money 'til the death of me
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww
I mean, we can't even rock them shoes
If it don't got a comma on the price tag, you know?
I mean, I mean but then again
Who, who looks at the price tag, you know?
Aww yeah we in this bitch 
Aww, aww, aww
Aww yeah we in this bitch
Aww, aww, aww
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

You—you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy huh?
You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don’t do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you’re the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you’re my sweetheart
I’ve always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together
Oh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?

Well, aren’t you a breath of fresh air?
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller think that they ain't got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
Like voila, you do it right he might just buy you a car
Now she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I’m buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarre
Independent with the demeanor of an R&B singer
Naked ring finger, M3 Beamer
Champagne Range, Triple white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
Alexander Mc
Queen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louis and Bebe
You ain't needy, greedy or easy as these other breezy's
Who fuck for bottles of Riesling and bowls of baked ziti
Oh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?

Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my NY girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big

Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big

Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done, hair done—nails done, hair done
Say go Cinderella, go Cinderella
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go 
Go, go, go, go, go 
Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we’ll spend it together
I’m down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don’t even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it
Oh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?

Uh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong
Got this little song for you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures
Shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it—
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
Ki-Killa, Killa
Girl you're the greatest
And if he say you ain't, girl he's out his mind
You're the finest
And if he say you ain't, that boy done lost his mind
Hey baby, every time you come around
Shut it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And let me put you in the Louboutins
What you want, what you need
I can be your everything
Them other niggas just wanna hit it
But if they had it, wouldn't know what to do with it
And together we shut it down, down, down
They know we shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice  they'd notice 
That we shut it down, down, down
They know we shut it down, down, down
Every time we come around, round, round
And they'd notice  they'd notice
You shut it down
TMZ, Concrete Loop
You shut that motherfucker down, down
Ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down, down
Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine
But she don't have my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl
Who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around, it's obvious—
You shut that thing down, you shut it down 
You shut it down, you shut it down 
You shut it down, you shut it down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
You shut it, ohh
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You looking good girl, go, go, go get em girl
Go, go, go hit em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You looking good girl, go, go, go get em girl
Go, go, go hit em girl, go, go, go, go go go
You shut it down
You shut it down, down, down, down
The way I’m feeling, the things I say
All just happen when you pass my way
What can I do to make you stay?
I know it’s getting late, but girl I don’t want you to leave
You tell me you’re just not the type, you wanna do this right
And I’m not trying to say I don’t believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take those fucking heels off, it’s worth it girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won’t forget me
You’ll be happy that you let me
Lay you down, down, down
I’m trying to lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
They'd notice, they'd notice
Let me lay you down, down, down
Trying to lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it
Let me know, let me know
Ahhh, let me know
Let me know, let me know
Uhh, yeah
This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I haven’t slept in days and me and my latest girl agreed
To go our separate ways, so I’m single
Thinkin' 'bout what we had and missin' you
But I ain't Santa, I got somethin' for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me tryin' not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthafuckin' heart out
It's Drizzy, always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, I’m learnin' to behave
And still spendin' every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good, I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m lookin' forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin' from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed, I promise to stay the same
I'm just
I’m just ridin' 'round the city
With my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that 
I just really hope that 
I just really hope that 
I'm doing my thing, I'm doing my thing, I'm doing my thing
This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say "for life" y'all say "forever"
It's hard but it's fair, I told that girl life hurts
The closest your gon' get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The name's Young baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I’ma need a thug wife
Yeah, I’m talkin' his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a Snickers bar
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
Same shit in them streets, so what's the dilly?
Young done everything in the A but fuck Chilli
So welcome to my life: no two days the same
Like for y'all to meet the love of my life her name's the game
I’m just ridin' 'round the city
With my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that 
I just really hope that 
I just really hope that 
I'm doing my thing, I'm doing my thing, I'm doing my thing
Got this top dropped on this beautiful night
This beautiful night to live my beautiful life
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife
Yeah, Drizzy we got em lil brah, unforgettable
You’ll never forget this, ya understand me?
Timeless homie, unforgettable
I've been up for four days, gettin' money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinkin', how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me: "Nobody's workin' as hard as you."
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probly true
'Cause while all of my closest friends out partyin'
I'm just here makin' all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous: prom night, nigga
I grow tired of these fuckin' grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
But I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park, stuntin' hard in his yellow goose
And I'm a motherfuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless, and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talkin' to themselves, Hov: hands free
And I'm just fillin' up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star: no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends: Kelsey Grammer
That's what life becomes when you're doin' you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow-talkin' with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gonna tell another nigga
When she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go
Oww, hoes turn they heads like owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flowin', I'm connected to a higher power
Bright lights will make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight 'cause the satellite was crispy
Y'all can miss me with the money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
Uh, I don't do too much bloggin'
I just run the town, I don't do too much joggin'
I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here's how they gon' come at you
With silly rap feuds, tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini meet, watch for the traitors
I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dum-dums could done him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let them tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would have went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas! Bitches, too!
All I got is this money — this will do
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go
I said "Tell me what's really going on?"
"Drizzy back up in this thing I'm ready, what's happening?"
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfucking scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothing ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, your bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice
 Yeah, I got 'em Bun
I love myself cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table stacking dollars to the perfect height
Work something, twerk something, basis
She just tryna make it so she's right here getting naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her—but I could never love her
Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feeling sorry for whoever got to sweep up
Yeah bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stands for "Do Right And Kill Everything"
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fucking did it
And girl I'm fucking serious, I'm with it if you with it
Cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealing flows cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rolling
So come and get a portion of this money that we be blowing
Cause it's on...
Yeah, girl it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone
Ooh shit, motherfucker, goddamn
Kicking bitches out the condo like Pam
Getting money every day, I'm a groundhog
'Bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man I swear my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ughhh, that's nasty
Yes I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell their friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbates to me, that's how she learn every song
To women I condone better write me when I'm gone
No I'm not that thuggish not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lying I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lying in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man I got so many styles I am a group
Damn, I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it I ain't tripping, I know Drizzy gonna kill 'em
I'm sticking to the script like lint on denim
Mama said if the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em
Real nigga talking, shut the fuck up, ho
Gotta do it one time for Haiti, what up, Zo?
Weezy F Baby and the "F" is for "front door"
Cause that's where I bring it, soo-woo if you banging, motherfucker
Yeah, girl it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone
Uh, yeah, forever in our hearts
JJ, we love you boy—H-Town!
I’m gone, I’m gone, I’m gone
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I just hope that you miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me
Miss me a little when I’m gone
Miss me a little when I’m gone, gone, gone
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
All night I've, been staring, can you tell I want you?
Can't be too, wide open, there's nothing, I won't do
Oh, just thought you should know
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious
I wish I, wasn't famous
I wish I, was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you, crazy
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious
I'm more than just an option 
Refuse to be forgotten 
I took a chance with my heart, 
And I feel it taking over
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I'm more than just a number 
I doubt you'll find another 
So every single summer 
I'll be the one that you'll remember and—
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
It's more than just a mission 
You hear, but you don't listen 
You better pay attention 
And get what you've been missing
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now
Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties to men
That I know well, that way there are no lies
You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of influential, I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just want to party, Patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
OVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who would have thought the route we'd chosen
Would ever end up the scenic?
I can relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time
That your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike
But got to A.I. him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us
So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
That you take for granted, you can thank me now
And oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome
At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
Cause they think that I can help them
Get back to where they fell from
But drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
That's how you know it's going down
In case another chance never comes around
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now
Shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it
Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
Man, the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion
Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
Do I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes
Who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
But those same ones from your area will grow into women
That are ready to get married at hello
Because of what they allowed, where are they all now?
I know they're somewhere watching
So I'm trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
They say the doors will open up
Soon as you find the missing key
That's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagon's full
But you can try and run behind it, I'm sorry
Poolside drinking, Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game
In which the cards are facing down
I'm in a world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now
These are my One St. Thomas flows
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go
Discussing life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Whatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing
If you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays
I just came off making two million in 30 days
Damn, "I guess it does" is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because
With Weezy I'm just out here repping us
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah
I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze
Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeah
Uh, yeah, this what yall want
Octobers Very Own
Young Money
ATF
Thank me later in this bitch wasssup
Free Weezy in this bitch wasup
June 15th in this bitch wasup

‘Cause some things just don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
Some want a bigger stage
They came to see you spit your game
But it shouldn't be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again
You hate the fame, love the game
Cold as ice you remain, fuck them all
Tell them all eat shit, here we go again
God damn! Is it that time again already?
Y'all don’t look too happy to see me
Fuck man, don’t everybody welcome me back at once
All right, fuck y’all then!
You can get the dick, just call me the ball sack, I'm nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch, dog—fall back, you mutts!
Fuck your worms, you've never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck it, a sick duck,  I want my duck sicked, mommy
And my nuts licked, gobble them up trick, yummy
Bitch, you don't fuckin' think I know
That you suck dick, dummy?
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit, honey
Yeah, I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny
Shorty, dance, while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah, struck a nerve
Sucker, motherfucker, might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, ‘cause I'm just a mean cocksucker
The shit is on ‘cause you went and pissed me off
Now I'm shittin' and pissin' on everybody
Give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So puff the Buddha, light a bong, but take a look at Mariah
Next time I inspire you to write a song—come on!
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's 20 below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh
Fuck it, I'm a loose cannon
Bruce Banner's back in the booth
Y'all are sittin' ducks, I'm the only goose standin'
I'll set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fuckin' around
Mothafucka, I'll show you pussy-footin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt 'til it makes a queef
And sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin'?
You must've mistook me for some sissy soft punk
Lookin' for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead, fuckin' hater, push me!
I told you ain't no fuckin' way to shush me
Call me a faggot ‘cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up, sissy, G's up
All you gardeners freeze up
Put your hoes down, “Shady ease up!
Man, chill!”, naw I can't, goddamn it, rap is a landfill
Drop the anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill
Shit the day that happens the world will stop spinnin'
And Michael J. Fox'll come to a standstill
During a earthquake urine in your face
‘Cause you're fake, ah! What the fuck? That hurt, wait!
Ah what the fuck! I just got struck by lightnin'
All right then, I quit, God, I give up
Call it evil that men do
Lord, forgive me for what my pen do
“This is for your sins, I cleanse you
And you can repent, but I warn you
If you continue, to Hell I'll send you”
And just then the wind blew, and I said...
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's 20 below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh-oh
How long will I be this way? Shady until my dyin' day
'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
"So long," 'til then I'll drop the fuckin' bombs
Like I missed the pass when I went long
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that
Learn the words to the song
"Oh, bitches don't like that," homie, I'll be nicer to women
When Aquaman drowns
And the Human Torch starts swimmin'
Man, I'm a cold soul, I roll solo
So, don't compare me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums, yeah
I'm bananas, pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with Auto-tune
The last thing you want to do
Is have me spit out a rhyme
And say, "I was writing this, and I thought of you," so
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's 20 below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't know, I don't know what caused
I don't know what caused me to be this way
I don't know, I don't know
But I'll probably be this way 'til my dyin' day
I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold
Mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made me
Ayo, before I start this song, man
I just wanna thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one
I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew
I was goin' through growin' pains
Hatred was flowin' through my veins
On the verge of goin' insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin'
And I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too, God, it
Feels like I'm goin' psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even? You're lyin' to yourself
You're slowly dyin', you're denyin' your health
Is declinin' with your self-esteem, you're cryin' out for help
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one
Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle
Maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though
But I must be talkin' to the wall though
I don't see nobody else 
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado
He's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
Inside him, one foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Falling asleep with writer's block in the parking lot of Mc
Donald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself
Do something 'bout it, admit you got a problem
Your brain is clouded, you pouted
Long enough, it isn't them: it's you, you fuckin' baby!
Quit worrying 'bout what they do, and do Shady
I'm fuckin' going crazy
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one
So I picked myself off the ground
And fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice
Suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushin' them out
I've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around
I got somethin' to prove to fans, 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me
And homie, I don't show no signs of slowin' up
Oh, and I'm blowin' up all over
My life is no longer a movie, but the show ain't over, homos
I'm back with a vengeance, homie
Weezy, keep ya head up, T.I., keep ya head up
Kanye, keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin' them, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day, and um
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one
So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else, I'm BACK! Ha ha
You know, critics, man
Critics never got nothin' nice to say, man
You know, the one thing I notice about critics, man
Is critics never ask me how my day went
Well, I'ma tell 'em
Yesterday my dog died
I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said: "Next time you blog, try to spit a flow."
You wanna criticize, dog? Try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up, so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter, here I go
Flows tighter, hot-headed as Ghost Rider
Cold-hearted as Spiderman throwing a spider in the snow
So you better get lower than Florida
Inside of a lowrider with no tires, in a hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes?
Listen, dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf, this is a blistering assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt, so get lost
Shit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off the Wizard of Oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers, gizzards, and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him, and visit his dog
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot its like you're burning up
Everyone else's cold
Man, I'm so fuckin' sick
I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit
You need to stop, drop, and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get
The whole Hip Hop shop to blow
I just put a bullshit hook in between two long-ass verses
If you mistook this for a song, look, this ain't a song
It's a warning to Brooke Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over, so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
I pop up, you bitches scatter like hot grease splashing a fan
Mr. Mathers is the man, yeah, I'm pissed
But I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man
Turn him into plastic
So for you to think that you could stand a fuckin' chance is asinine
Yeah, ask Denaun, man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon
Fuck it, I ain't playin', pull up in a van
And hop out on a homeless man holding a sign sayin'
"Vietnam vet," I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can, beat his ass, and leave him 9 grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute
You wanna get graphic, we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke
On a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop
Sayin' you sick, quit playin', you prick, don't nobody care
And why the fuck am I yellin' at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one, 'cause ain't nobody there
And nobody will fuckin' test me
'Cause these hoes won't even dare
I'm wasting punchlines, but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Nah, don't waste it, save it, psycho, yeah
Plus you got to rewrite those lines
That you said about Michael's hair 
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot its like you're burning up
Everyone else's cold
Man, I'm so hot my motherfuckin' firetruck's on fire, homie
You need to stop, drop, and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get
The whole Hip Hop shop to blow
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no
Cadillac Sevilles, coupe De
Villes
Brain-dead rims, yeah, stupid wheels
Girl, I'm too for real, lose your tooth-and-nail
Tryna fight it, try to deny it, stupid you will feel
What I do, I do at will
Shootin' from the hip, yeah boy, I shoot to kill
Half a breath left on my death-bed
Screaming, “F that!” – yeah, super-ill
Baby, what the deal? We can chill
Split a half a pill and a Happy Meal
Fuck a steak slut, I'll cut my toes off
And step on the receipt 'fore I foot the bill
Listen, garden tool, don't make me introduce you
To my power tool, you know the fuckin' drill
How you douchebags feel knowin' you're disposable?
Summer's Eve, Massengill
Shady's got the mass appeal
Baby, crank the shit, 'cause it's your goddamn jam
You said that you want your punchlines a little more compact—well, shorty, I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at, man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium
And said: “Settle your fuckin' ass down!
I'm ready for combat, man!”
Get it? Calm Batman, nah
Ain't nobody who's as bomb and as nuts
Lines are like Mom's CAT-scans
'Cause they fuckin' go bananas
Honey, I applaud that ass
Swear to God, man, these broads can't dance
Ma, show them how it's done
Spaz like a goddamn Taz, yeah
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no
Girl, shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's
Make like Michael J. Fox is in your drawers
Playin' with an etch-a-sketch
Bet you that you'll never guess
Who's knockin' at your door, people hit the floors
Yeah, tonight, ladies, you gonna get divorced
Girl, forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads
With Chris's force like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue, mothafucka
You ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
Makin' cash registers shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest?
I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin' on your kitchen floor
In other words, I'm off the meat rack
Bring the beat back, bring in two extension cords
I'ma measure my dick—shit, I need six inches more
Fuck, my dick's big, bitch, need I remind you
That I don't need the fuckin' swine flu to be a sick pig?
You're addicted, I'm dope
I'm the longest needle around here—need a fix, ock?
I'm the big shot—get it, dick-snots?
You're just small pokes, little pricks
Girl, you think that other prick's hot?
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
Before I sit back and let him get hotter
Better call the cops on him quick, fast
Shady's right back on your bitch-ass
White trash with a half a six-pack in his hatchback
Trailer hitch attached to the back, dispatch
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no
Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin'?
Does a bird chirp? Does Lil' Wayne slurp 'zurp
'Til he burps and smoke purp?
Does a word search get circles wrapped around it
Like you do when I come through?
I'd like you to remind yourself of what the fuck I can do
When I'm on the mic
Oh, you're the kind of girl that I could take a likin' to
Psych! I'm spikin' you like a football
Been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the wood-grain
Don't want no cum stain—bitch, you listenin'?
Tryin' to turn me down, slut, I'm talkin' to you
Turn me back up! Are you insane?!
Tryin' to talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'!
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the saying? Where there's thunder, there is light-
-ning and they say that it never strikes twice in the same place, so how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations on four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stankin' ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psycho path
Poison Ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash
So hit the dance-floor, cutie, while I do my duty
On this microphone; shake your booty, shorty!
I'm the shit—why you think Proof used to call me "Doody"?
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no
Yeah! Oh! Get up
Where my dreads at? I said, get up
You know what happens when I'm around, man
Woo! Let's go
Better watch out now
'Cause here we come
And we ain’t stoppin'
Until we see the morning sun
So give us room to do our thing
'Cause we ain’t come to hurt no one
So everybody come and get up on the floor now
And grab someone
Man, first of all, I’m a boss
I just want to get that across
Man, even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it’s a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows
Spray painted doors with the flames on ‘em
Michigan plates and my name's on ‘em
Baby, Shady’s here
Come and get him if you dames want him
But he ain’t stupid
So quit tryna run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid
Why you tryna put your claims on him?
'Cause you won’t do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
There’s a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance?
She’s got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan
We call ‘em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me
Time to put the damn clamps down
And show this hussy who’s the man
Now get amped, dance
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party
So let’s have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain’t no one but us trash
You don’t know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we’re having a white trash party
Pull a fifth of Bacardi from outta my underwear
And walk around the party without a care
Like a body without a head
Looking like a zombie from Night of the Living Dead
And tomorrow I'll probably still be too high to get out of bed
'Til I feel like I been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
Mixing Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like I’m hollering "Die Santa"
Missed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
So quit tryna play the wall like you Paul
And get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stalling
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darling
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'
Making it rain for the ladies in the minis
But I’m not throwing ones, fives, tens, or even twenties
I’m throwing quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny’s
From the North, East, and West
But when it comes to them trailers in them South parks
Muffle it, 'cause homie that hood’s tighter than Kenny’s
So ladies, if your belly button’s not an innie, then I’m outtie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy
Come on
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party
So let’s have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain’t no one but us trash
You don’t know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we’re having a white trash party
Now whether you’re black, white, or purple
If you’re misunderstood
But you don’t give a fuck
You ain’t doing shit that you should
Long as you know you’re up to evil
And you’re no damn good
Get on the floor, man and rep your hood
Now honey, don’t let them pricks trip
We should make a quick dip
And go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot
'Cause girl, I got a sick whip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk
Rip out the stick shift
And make a five-seater
I’ll be damned if I feed a chick
It ain’t like me to split a piece of dry pita
I be the S-L-to-the-I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y
And I don’t need a tank top to be a wife beater
I’ll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I’ll tell you now
I’m so raw, I still need to unthaw
You feel me y'all?
I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby, a body like that’s against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party
So let’s have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain’t no one but us trash
You don’t know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we’re having a white trash party
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
Lately I really feel like I'm rollin' for delph like Philly
Feel like I'm losin' control of myself, I sincerely
Apologize if all that I sound like is I'm complainin'
But life keeps on complicatin'
And I'm debatin' on leavin' this world this evenin'
Even my girls can see I'm grievin'
I try and hide it, but I can't
Why do I act like I'm all high and mighty, when inside I'm dyin'?
I am finally realizin' I need help, I can't do it myself, too weak
Two weeks I've been havin' ups and downs
Going through peaks and valleys
Dilly-dallyin' around with the idea of endin' the shit right here
I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryna fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah
I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck, only thing I fear is Hailie
I'm afraid if I close my eyes I might see her… shit
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon
Yeah, Dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you
Marshall, what happened that you can't stop with these pills?
And you've fallen off with your skills
And your own fans are laughin' at you
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle?
Get up, be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out
Homie just whipped out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at nobody, he'd fight first
But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm poppin' Vics, Percs and Methadone pills
"Yeah, Em, tight verse, you killed it!"
Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men
And they gonna do whatever I says when I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then—
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
My friends can't understand this new me
That's understandable, man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too
If you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you
What you want me to do?
I'm startin' to live like a recluse
And the truth is, fame startin' to give me an excuse
To be at an all-time low; I sit alone in my home theater
Watchin' the same damn DVD of the
First tour; the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurts so I fast forward
Sleeping pills'll make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I'll just take a couple more, yeah, you're motherfuckin' right
I ain't slowin' down for no one
I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie, come on, dole 'em out!
"Daddy, don't you die on me!
Daddy, better hold your ground!"
Fuck, don't I know the sound
Of that voice? Yeah, baby, hold me down!
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes
But somehow I'm pullin' through
Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof
I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few
Facts, 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit, it just hit me that, what if I would not've made it through?
I think about the things I woulda never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day
We just could never get it together, hey
Wish there was a better way for me to say it
But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain
When it rains, guess it pours — yes, it does
Wish there wasn't any pain, but I can't pretend there ain't
I ain't placin' any blame
I ain't pointin' fingers, Heaven knows I've never been a saint
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today I looked at your picture, almost as if to say
I miss you subconsciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away
Don't know why, I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm—
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me, I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me
I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or "how can he"
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album, he's
Still shittin', whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a "fuck you" for Christmas: his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole Universe
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
For you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was “ehhhh”
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
‘Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out
But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
‘Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
‘Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
I don't know, man
Just feels like we're a lot different
It kinda feels like
I'm on a whole different page right now than you
It feels strange, but umm
I guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like…
I feel like I'm morphin' into somethin' that's so incredible
That I'm dwarfin' all competitors
Better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphins I effect
Your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blastin' out your deck
She loves me, such passion, you'd expect
This sort of reaction from her, yet you strong-arm
You're fuckin' corny, you try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop the Don Juan
But if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like Ed Lover, "C'mon, son!"
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like, "She's fuckin' with dude, she wants him."
Homeboy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do?
How you expect her to act in the sack
When she's closin' her eyes
Fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track?
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
She's sittin' there gettin' liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you than to count the things that are
There's a seven-disc CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot, and you're not — aww!)
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet: a star
And I'm not about to sit back
And just keep rhymin' one syllable — naw!
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'Cause they're just not good enough, but I'm not givin' up
'Til I get my respect and I won't stop 'til I get enough
'Cause I'm not livin' up to my own expectations 
That hater alarm is soundin' off
And Obama took the bomb from my name 
So quit cryin' that I took your dame, homie, she's my dame 
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that I'm not on my game, boy
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank, boy
But you got a hard on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man, I can't call it
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
It's like we're playin' lyrical tug of war with your ear
You hear it, girl? Come here
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear
While I freak this world premiere
Seducin' her, loosen up
With a little freestyle that'll— wait, am I losin' ya?
Am I makin' you look bad? Well, I got news for ya
Homie, you losin' her
Oh wait, she don't like when I spit it fast
Am I tryin' to show how? Let me slow it down some
It's still gonna be a blow-out
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
If you can save any of it, punk, but none of it's fuckin' with me
Prick, you really feelin' that bullshit?
You think you killin' them syllables? Quit
Playin', these beats ain't nothin' to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall: I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awe-struck
She's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
From suckin' my dick… aw, fuck
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Love, love
Love, love, love
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more, no more
Love
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "Fuck the world!" — get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothin' about her
Been to Hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go 'round fire expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on the triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's "Fuck what they say!"
I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away
Man, I come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage
Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just 
That's right 
And I don't need you 
Don't want to see you 
Bitch, you get 
You showed me nothin' but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
I don't need you 
That's right 
And I don't need you 
Don't want to see you 
Bitch, you get 
Bitch, you get 
And I don't need you ; get 'em!
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
In my whole entire life; I can
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
I'm a little bit sicker than, most
Shit's finna get thick again
They say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit, and I stick it in
I ain't never givin' in again
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em?
They call me a freak ‘cause I like to
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage!
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from 'em
Bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah, that rap was tight
But I'm 'bout spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
You can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, ‘cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it
‘Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick ‘cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow; you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck: keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just 
That's right 
And I don't need you 
Don't want to see you 
Bitch, you get 
You showed me nothin' but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
I don't need you 
That's right 
And I don't need you 
Don't want to see you 
Bitch, you get 
Bitch, you get 
And I don't need you 
Ha! Bitch, you get no love
We touch, I feel a rush; we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible: gained my trust
Don't play games, it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over, ‘cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya
What it's like to hurt, ‘cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil — spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold
Walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own
It's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses
What the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like tryin' to start over
I got a hole in my heart, but some kinda emotional roller coaster
Something I won't go on
So you toy with my emotions, ho, it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya
Wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova, and I'm a—
I'm a space-bound rocket ship
And your heart's the Moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you, right at you
I'll do whatever it takes
When I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one, then once we get 'em it's never the same
You want them when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake
What the fuck does it take? Let's cut to the chase
'Fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake, ‘cause I'm a—
I'm a space-bound rocket ship
And your heart's the Moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you, right at you
So, after a year and six months
It's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you
Let down my guard, swear to God
I blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin'
I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this:
And I would've did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me every time
You look up in the sky and see a star, ‘cause I'm a—
I'm a space-bound rocket ship
And your heart's the Moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you, without you
Yeah, you know, technically
I'm not even really supposed to be here right now
So fuck it, might as well make the most of it
{In the background: Amen, Amen}
Yeah! Ha ha, feels good
Guess I'm lucky
Some of us don't get a second chance
But I ain't blowin' this one
Nah, man, ha ha
Shit, I feel like I can do anything now
Who can catch lightning in the bottle, set fire to water
Comin' out the nozzle on the fire hose, flyer than swatters
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand
Take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme and freeze the clock
Take the hands of time and cuff 'em
There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start to bug, prick, you better flee, 'cause I get ticked
It's a wrap, I was down when I was down, I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch you to the ground, you trick!
It's a trap, fuck my last CD, the shit's in my trash
I'll be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes
And keep winkin' and blowin' kisses
'Cause you're flirtin' with death
I'm destroyin' your livelihood, I ain't just hurtin' your rep
I catch a flow and get goin'
No remorse I'm showin', ain't slowin' for no one
Knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it
Zero in on the target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid saliva—what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up
Stand behind you like "Whooo!"
That boy's hot enough to melt Hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See, you can hate him, he don't blame you
Frankly, he would too
This game couldn't afford to lose him, how 'bout you?
Now guess who? Here's a clue
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass, he's in your ass
He's all up in your psyche too
Now, what's his name?
If I had a time machine, I'd be Cinderella Man
Music is my time machine, so call me
Fuck catchin' lightning, he struck it
Screamed "Shut up!" at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down
And made it rain upward
Rewound the future to the present
Paused it – don't ask how
Fuck the past, mothafucka
He's the shit right now, he's
Cinderella man, Cinder Fellow, Shady dane
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane
Raise hell, from Hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same old
Can't afford to be a lame-o
In this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say bye to the old, H-I to the new
Que será, consider it his last hurrah
The coup de grâce, raise 'em high
In the sky, keep 'em up, time to bring the place alive
Thanks for bein' patient, I
Will make no more mistakes, shit, my
Potato's baked, homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin' weed—yeah, faggot, the steaks are high
Shit, I ain't even suppose to be here by the grace of God
The skin of my teeth and the hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights, I'd hate to lie
How fuckin' irritated are you? How much in your face am I?
It ain't shit you could do but fear it, Proof is here in spirit
And I'm the spittin' image, I mirror it when I stand near it
Your pussy lyric, I "cunt" hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists
Who? Here's a clue
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass, he's in your ass
He's all up in your psyche too
Now, what's his name?
If I had a time machine, I'd be
Music is my time machine, so call me
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life, I woulda laid
Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain
Bitch, you took me for granted
Took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt, I can no longer stand it
Now my respect, I demand it
I'ma take control of this relationship, command it
And I'ma be the boss of you now, goddamn it
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid?
Look at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothin' left
But you keep treatin' me like a staircase: it's time to fuckin' step
And I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in depth
I told you you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left
I laughed while you wept, how's it feel now?
Yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me
Did me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate, but it's…
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you, all you do is laugh
‘Cause that ain't good enough
You expect me to fold myself in half 'til I snap
Don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side? I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time?
You don't think so, do you?
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still? Man, I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you – go marry someone else and make 'em famous!
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat
I'm moving on, forget you
Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this
So many times it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep askin' me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm drawn to shit, I guess I'm a
Mess, cursed and blessed, but this time I
Ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss
You're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people
Who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you, Hip-Hop! I'm leavin' you
My life sentence is served, bitch, and it's just…
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase 25 to life
Too late
Caught in a chase 25 to life
Yeah, haha, you feel that, baby?
Yeah, I feel it too, damn
You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together
You see, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was, am I?
I’m the American Dream
I’m the definiton of white trash ballin’
I’m right back on 'em
With a  I can’t call it
Same shit, different toilet
Oh, you got a nice ass, darling
Can’t wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin’? You take me for a friend?
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady’s origin
You’ll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now, it all started with my father
I must’ve got my pimpin' genes from him
The way he left my momma
I’m a rolling stone, just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby, I’ll make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as me
I’m as calm as the breeze
I’m the bee’s knees, his legs, and his arms
I'm a superstar, girl, I’m ready for you, mama
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas?
So bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad
Guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had
‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
So bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad
Guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had
‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo
First I’ll kiss your navel, work my way down
Baby, you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find somethin' more stable
I told you I ain't fooling from the gate
This ain't the first day of April
But thank you for staying, April
I'ma make you learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phony, little fishy and sissy fake G’s
Skip over the "huggy bear," and all the "kissy face," please
Initiate phase three, missy, now service me
Take another shot of Jäger, shakin' so nervously
Take your time, baby, oh, you’re the bomb, baby
Oh, you’re doing that even better than your mom, lady
I told you why I’m Shady, you didn't listen now, did ya?
Relax woman, you know that I’m only kiddin' with ya
Got a twisted sense of humor, its warped, but I didn't hit ya
I think you’re finally starting to get the picture
I’m just…
So bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad
Guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had
‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
So bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad
Guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had
‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go
‘Cause I'm on to the next girl
And the next girl I kind of like, oh
I got you caught up in the rapture
Make you recapture the feelings you had for
Your last boyfriend, before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad, you're
Sweating, but if I’m what you wanted
Why’d you panic when I grabbed ya?
Girl, don't be so frantic, I’m just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of somethin' that's so organic
You can’t ignore it, so don't, just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let’s get to camcording
Damn, shawty, I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on the napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back
And throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blind that
You couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a line-up
So stop at the store, pick a pint up
Let's get the pineapple Schnapps going, no one will knock
‘Cause I'ma hang a sign up saying "DON'T DISTURB"
Shawty, I’m so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?
So bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad
Guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had
‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
So bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad
Guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had
‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go
‘Cause I am on to the next girl
And the next girl I kind of like, oh
So bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad
Guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had
‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
So bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad
Guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had
‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I can almost taste it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost see it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost taste it
Can't stop now
This might be the last chance I get
To be famous
You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but…
Be careful what you wish for
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed-up post office worker
I murk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off, get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you sure did shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
How thangs turn around when his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowin' your mind
When I come back, like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack that you slept on, son
Now here I come screaming "Attack!"
Like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem 'til he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His britches, he out grow'd em
He's so out cold he's knocked out at the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him, rigor mortis and post mortem
He's dyin' of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em, then try to thwart him
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit-stained drawers, you gon' fuck with a guy
Who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce?
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backin' down?
You must be out of your dang skulls; I'm almost famous
You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but…
Be careful what you wish for
I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle, that ain't happenin' again
I'm at your throat like strep, I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand
Some are just stored in my memory
Some I wrote on a napkin; I do what I have to to win
Pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers?
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the wacko before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick! 'Dick' is too short of a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick!
Don't call me the Champ
Call me the Space Shuttle Destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger; matter fact, I need a lawyer
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
Y'all are Eminem backwards: you're Mini Me's
See, he's in a whole nother weight class
He's slugs, you're BB's: you're bean-bag bullets
You're full of it, you were dissin' his CD's
Laughed at Infinite
Now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention
Of the mighty D.R.E.—he's almost famous
You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but…
Be careful what you wish for
Now there he goes in Dre's studio, cuppin' his balls
Screamin' the wood off the panelin'
Cussin' the paint off the walls
Spewin' his hate to these haters
Showin' no love for these broads
He ain't given them shit
He says he'll pinch a penny so hard he'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out: "AHH!"
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked
Instead of suckin' him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie
To hang themselves by: like David Carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it
He's fuckin' had it, he's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman, girl
The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me
Take me back to 9th grade to school me
'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward
This whole spot blowin'
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?
And while I'm bein' poetic
Let me get it stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
So bear witness to some biblical shit
There's a cold wind blowin'
This world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it, “Wait!
Where you going?”, “I'm leaving you.” “No, you ain't
Come back!” We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snap, “Who's that dude?”, I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin'
Yeah, them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'd show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me when it comes to love
You're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back
I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
The days are cold, living without you
The nights are long, I’m growing older
I miss the days of old, thinking about you
You may be gone, but you’re never over
If Proof could see me now, I know he’d be proud
Somewhere in me deep down
There’s something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it’ll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me, clowns—that means "suicide," homie
You’ll never throw me off of this course, blow me!
Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I’m not just talkin' awards, homie
And the ball's in my court and it’s lonely
On top of the world, when you’re the only
One with the balls in your shorts
To leave their jaws on the floors with no re-morse
Remember that when they get to doggin' you boy, homie
So y’all can just get to bloggin' about bologna
I’m not gonna stop, the saga continues
No stoppin' the force, Obi, I’m moppin' the floors
With them, I keep tryin' to pass it
But they keep on droppin' the torch
And it won’t be long 'til this sport is O-V-E-R
Just Blaze and me, we are knockin' on doors, and no we
Ain’t pumpkins on Halloween
But we’ll show up on your porch, so be careful what you say
There ain’t no punks over here, so follow me
Through the fog like I’m S-N-double-O-P
Let me guide you through the smoke, G
If only I wasn’t travelin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don’t think you understand how much you meant to me
The days are cold, living without you
The nights are long, I’m growing older
I miss the days of old, thinking about you
You may be gone, but you’re never over
And it don’t stop, oh-oooh
And it don’t quit, oh-oooh
And it don’t stop, oh-oooh
And it don’t quit, oh-oooh
And I miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
Homie, I’ll never forget you, nooo
For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it’ll blow up the mic, it’ll put the "dyna" in mite
Yeah, it’ll make the dopest MC
Wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin' all over the beat
It’ll jump off the page and spit itself
Yeah, it’s the best thing I could do
Right now, Doody, for you is to rep
So I’m gonna fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'ma do it to death
And instead of mourning your death, I’d rather celebrate your life, elevate to new height
Step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need two mics
'Cause the way that I’m feelin' tonight
Everything I can just do right
There’s nothin' that I can do wrong
I’m too strong and I’m just too hyped
Just finished the rhyme and I bust it
And—excuse the corny metaphor—they’ll never catch up
To all this energy that I’ve mustered
So God just help me out
While I fight through this grieving process
Tryin' to process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain’t takin' me hostage
I’ve been patiently watchin' this game
Pacin' these hallways, you had faith in me always
Proof, you knew I’d come out of this slump
Rise from these ashes, come right back on they asses
And go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water
Slaughter 'em, holmes; I’ma own so many belts, the only place they can hit me is below 'em
Homie, I know I’m never gonna be the same without you
I never would've came in this game
I’m goin' insane without you
Matter of fact, it was just the other night
Had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me: "Naw, Doody you’re not!"
Layin' on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it soon as you said "think of Hailie," I knew
There wasn’t no way that I was ever
Gonna leave them babies, and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord, I’m so thankful
Please don’t think that I don’t feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need
For one more day to get through
So, homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you, Doody
The days are cold, living without you
The nights are long, I’m growing older
I miss the days of old, thinking about you
You may be gone, but you’re never over
And it don’t stop, oh-oooh
And it don’t quit, oh-oooh
And it don’t stop, oh-oooh
And it don’t quit, oh-oooh
And I miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
Homie, I’ll never forget you, nooo
Nah man, not quite finished yet
Girl, I think you just might've tried
To pull a motherfuckin’ fast one, I’m mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling
And that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade?
Tryin' to play games? See this saw blade?
See this silhouette of a stalker in your walkway?
Better cooperate or get sauteed
And rotisseried while you’re hog-tied
MC’s get so quiet
You can hear a motherfuckin' dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin’ Fall Guy
I don’t gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai
'Cause it will turn into a Gremlin
And run over kids, women, and men – Vrinn-Vrinn!
Motor so big you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin’?
Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spend-spend even ten cents on you, since when
Do you think it’s gonna cost me a pretty penny
Shit, if I think a penny’s pretty
Just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo
Catch an Eskimo by his toe while he’s tryin' to roll a snowball
But don’t make him lose his cool
If he hollers, better let him go, y’all
You don't own me
Now here we go, go, go
Get up, baby, get a move on like a U-Haul
You can rack your brain like pool balls
You won't ever think of this shit – yeah, honey, you called?
Well, here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it
Evil – I see, hear, and speak it
Lady, put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket
You can count every motherfuckin’ chicken 'fore it hatches
'Cause you can bet your ass that we gonna get it crackin’
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin'
Get your brains bashed in
So bad, you’re gonna have Kurt Cobain askin’
To autograph a bloodstained napkin
Unfashionable, and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fag’s asshole
Now let’s take that line, run it up the flagpole
With Elton, see if he’s cool with it
Don’t stand there and look stupid at
Me, bitch, I ain’t in the mood for this shit
Get my dick, Google it 'til it pops up
Y’all are so motherfuckin’ full of shit that you stopped up
Me, I’m always shittin' diarrhea of the mouth
'Til your speakers crap out Pfft, huh, what?
Girl you got a hot butt
Like a lit cigarette 
But you won’t get a hot fudge sundae from me
So do not strut my way, slut, because–
You don't own me
Here we go, go, go
And now that I got your panties in a bunch
And your bowels in an uproar
I'ma show you why I came, so you stop askin' me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut, cunt, whore
I know you want more
Bitch, it’s time to put the math back into Mathers
'Cause I’m a fuckin’ problem – run, boy!
Every flow, got it mastered
So every last word that you fuckin’ fags heard
Comes straight from the fish's ass
Yeah, in other words, I’m a bass-turd
Looking at me like I killed Kenny
Gas in the tank, yeah, still plenty
No morals are instilled in me
So remorse, I really don’t feel any
Eat your heart out, Hannibal, understandable
Why you jealous? Fuck an animal, I got cannibal magnetism
Can't resist him now – can you, ho?
“Shady, I don’t understand your flow.”
Understand my flow? Bitch, I flow like Troy Polamalu’s hair, boy
Don’t you dare try to follow or compare, boy
I’m raw, you ain’t even medium-rare
Stay the fuck outta my hair, boy
You can look, you can stare, and point
But you can’t touch, I’m too clairvoyant
I don’t get it, man, is there a void?
All this weak shit, what am I, steroids?
Well, bitch, I’m back with some shit for that ass
And your trunk, elephant hemorrhoids
And remember, boys–
You don't own me
Here we go go go
Thank you for coming out
I hope you enjoyed the show
Until next time
Peace
Aw man...
You ever be in the club man, you get in a fight
And people that you don't even know jump in?
You feel like you wanna hit something, your fist clenches, you're pissed
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
You're 'bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away
From splitting your shit wide open, no stitches can save
You'll die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
You end up going out, but I guess it just is I'm afraid
Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say "Isn't this great?"
On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
That's starting to take place in the middle of the street
Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene but it's too late
It's absolute pandemonium
Whisked away in an ambulance is your fate
Nothing nobody told you when you left the house today
Could of made you anticipate Such an ass-whipping, okay
'til the anger dissipates
You'll get punched in the face, reciprocate, come on
So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
You better go get your mace cause Shady said so
You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
That's how fuckin' rowdy you feel, now you still wanna grill?
If you don't wanna get the shit beat out of you, chill
Cause if you doubt me you will, yeah got me a pill, found me a thrill
I got a couple of drinks here, and I'm bound to refill
Girl howdy, how do you feel ma?
This cocksucker did not spill my drink, oh hell nah
He must be trying to kill my buzz
I will not budge, so what the deal ridaz?
Now here they all come and they got your back in like 2 seconds flat
And that's probably a record, yeah, you wasn't expecting that
Cause they want in on the act, there's a cognac bottle
We snuck it in cause the beer that they was serving here was only tap
I'm biting, I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts
You're frightened like "This guy might hurt me"
You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder
Play smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to
Dig your way out or go powder your nose
Pussy the louder you yell the harder I slap the shit outta you hoes
You set it off faggot so now how do you 'spose
We settle it, hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes
It's sheer hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
We're tussling, the crowd's starting to cheer us and
Adrenaline's rushing through us just like a geyser gushing
Too much Budweiser in my blood, I'm strangling your windpipe for nothing
My signature ligature marks, look at you all
Big with your remarks 'til I swing an icepick at your heart
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
And dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
The pain inflicted upon you is so sick it's Bizarre
Shit this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
As having me wanna rip out your fricking ligaments, ahh
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails for that
You catch an open hand slap like a female like bap
In fact I'll have the crowd smacking you themselves
Where's D12? I don't feel like doing this by myself, come on
Yeah, what the deal?
I'm feeling hard as hell right now homie
I almost feel... Invincible and shit
Ay Dre! You got me feeling like I can't be touched right now fool
I'm unstoppable
Damn
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
You ready to get this shit started or what?
Aight, well I brought some friends with me too
Now I ain't back just for the sake of just saying I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
Out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturin'
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurrin'
Whoa-oh, I can't see shit, my words get to slurrin'
Uh-oh! You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in
Trouble! What's occurring befo', after, and during the show
Has no bearing on the bad news I'm bearing, whoa
What is it, wordplay? No, I'm pushing you out the do'
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fucking feet 'til you get to squishing a ho
It's pandemonium, standing o when you see him, oh
Damn baby you look good, you're giving me wood
You should pull over like a sweatshirt with a hood
It's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both
Break bread while I'm copping over this game to pinch a loaf
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?
Who claims to be spitting the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end
Deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed
Came back an hour after the accident
And bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!
So stop faking the funk and start shaking your ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap
And Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazing than that?
Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at?
I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you
Lump on your head designed by a bar stool
Designed by a cartoon
Before I need to be hired, Jimmy I'll fire Marshall
The 9 tucked against the lining
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down
Like y'all are a couple 69ing
It's like Rick James is shooting up your house, nigga!
{rapid gunfire} FUCK YO' COUCH NIGGA!
You're screaming, "Fuck the world!" with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud
My bitch know I'm perfectly fit for murder
Because I murdered her, so you can call me
Nickel to O.J. to Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear
And ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred E. Neumann mad cerebral
You on your last burrito!
 It's a wrap if you eating
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on FIRE, nobody touching that
Good day and good night, Ortiz, yo, where the FUCK you at?
I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years
Ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at a nightmare
Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares
I harbor the art of my nice wear
It's type weird cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishing off his ninth beer
Homie chill, listen, I swear
I'm God, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be?
Just waiting to be hooked to IV as Mumm-Ra's
Well, when you look at my pee
And this joint no exception, so just point a direction
And record the pig's oink when I rip his intestine
This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose
After they did an inspection, what I exhibit
Seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Edimminem
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgusting hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?
I'm right here letting the shotty pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked
And your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped
I take your life to the ninth inning
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winning
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Man, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches
Then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
I ball like Iguodala
I bear more arms than 6 koalas
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah
Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam!
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flying
We do it to try to do without tryin
 Cause to it's us it's so easy
Where's Jumpoff Joe Beezy?
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it, reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing?
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight I bet you that what you're 'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this."
Heart's saying: "I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset."
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think ‘cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me; cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin'
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And, gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reached my full potential: I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat caught your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, gag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat
You can have that shit back ‘cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in the car right now – wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my
Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!
Last album now, ‘cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!
Slim: "Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha, big bro, it's for you, Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!
I also represent
Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approachin' its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, ‘cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packin' a wallop
So, one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist
Tortured, trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up where the last Mathers left off
Don't kill me!
Hurry the fuck up! 
Thank you! 
Go, go, go! What the... fuck? The fuck did he go?
Mothafucka bail on me? Fuck you! 
Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding me!
Are you fucking kidding me? Shit! 
Get off! 
Ha-ha! 
Parking lot! Shit, ah!
Let me see your hands, bend over!
Ah, fuck it!
 Marshall
 I don't have one
 My mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle, then crashed in
The side of loco-motive with rap, I'm
Loco, it's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'Bout to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap, "In a spasm
Your music usually has 'em
But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't
Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan."
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and
Thoughts are entertainin'
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seein' eye dog
Can't even find the page I was writing this rhyme on
Oh, it's on the ram-page
Couldn't see what I wrote, I write small
It says, "Ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with whitewalls
Had a fire in my heart
And a dire desire to aspire to Die Hard."
So as long as I'm on the clock, punching this time card
Hip-hop ain't dying on my watch
Now sometimes when I'm sleepin'
She comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine?
Don't got time, don't care, don't have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand to promised land
And threaten everyone
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing
 Marshall
 I don’t know him, but I wonder
 Ha

No, if he had
He wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad
Yeah, Dad, I'm the epitome and the prime
Example of what happens when the power of the rhyme
Falls into the wrong hands and
Makes you want to get up and start dancin'
Even if it is Charles Manson
Who just happens to be rappin', blue lights flashin'
Laughin' all the way to the bank, lampin' in my K-Mart mansion
I’m in the style department
With a pile in my cart, rippin' the aisle apart but
With great power comes
Absolutely no responsibility for content
Completely despondent and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy is on a
Beat-killing spree, Your Honor
I must plead guilty, 'cause I sparked a revolution
Rebel without a cause who caused the evolution
Of rap, to take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
Does that mean it belongs to me?
'Cause I just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you hear a beep
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, 'cause it's the—
It's the time of the season
When hate runs high
And this time, I won't give it to you easy
When I take back what's mine
With pleasured hands
And torture everyone, that is my plan
My job here isn't done
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing
 Shady
 I don’t give a fuck, but I wonder
 Doubt it, ha

So yeah, Dad, let's walk
Let's have us a father and son talk
But I bet we wouldn't probably get one block
Without me knocking your block off, this is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm so bananas I a-ppealed to all those walks
Of life, whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'Cause I related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're rippin' out their fuckin' hair again, it's hysterical
I chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
Yeah, uh-oh, better beware, knuckle heads!
The sign of my hustle says:
"Don't knock, the door's broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold-cocked
You critics come to pay me a visit?
Misery loves company, please stay a minute!"
Kryptonite to a hypocrite
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy gettin' stoned in your glass house
To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out
Mr. Mathers as advertised on the flyers, so spread the word
'Cause I'm promoting my passion until I'm passed out
Completely brain-dead: Rain Man
Doing a Bankhead in a restraint chair
So, bitch, shoot me a look, it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas
I'm angrier than all eight other reindeer
Put together with Chief Keef 'cause I hate every fuckin' thang, yeah
Even this rhyme, bitch
And quit tryin' look for a fuckin' reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a "Criminal!"
Ten-year-old degenerate grabbin' on my genitals!
The last Mathers LP done went diamond
This time I'm predicting this one will go emerald!
When will the madness end?
How can it when there's no method to the pad and pen?
The only message that I have to send
Is: "Dad, I'm back at it again!"
Yeah… 
You fuckin' groupie!
Pick up the goddamn phone!
Bitch, where the fuck were you Tuesday?
With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio, bitch, what'd you do? Screw Dre?
You went there lookin' for me? Boo, that excuse is too lame
Keep playin' me, you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg
You fake, lyin' slut, you never told me you knew Drake
And Lupe? You want to lose two legs?
You tryin' to flip this on me?
If I spent more time with you, you say
"Okay, yeah, and I'm coo-coo, eh?", well, screw you
And I'll be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, fourth—Dre, Drake, Lupe—oohm, touché
You were too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one true-blue ace, but you ain't
And I can't see you when you make that wittle boo-boo face
'Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo
You make my fuckin' Bluetooth ache
You're feeling blue? Too late; go smurf yourself!
You make me wanna smurf and puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit
Just be a lot easier if you dropped dead?
I would feel so much better
Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway tryna get some time alone and just think
'Til the cops pulled me over
But they let me go, 'cause I told 'em I'm only drivin' drunk
'Cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my fuck hoes, with a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias? I hate all bitches the same, baby, come on!
Excuse the pun, but bitch is such a broad statement, and I'm
Channelin' my anger through every single station that's on
'Cause a woman broke my he-art
I say he-art 'cause she ripped it in two pa-arts
And threw it in the garbage; who do you think you a-are?
Bitch, guess it's time for me to get the dust off
And pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again
I Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo… Lesbian! Aaahhh!
I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
My life'd be so much better if you just—
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit
Just be a lot easier if you dropped dead?
I would feel so much better
'Cause you told me
You'd love me forever
Bitch, that was a lie
Now I never wanted someone
To die so bad in my fuckin' life
But fuck it, there’s other fish in the sea
And I'ma have a whale of a time, bein' a single sailor
For the night, bitch, on a scale of
One to ten, shit, I must be the Holy Grail of
Catches, ho, I got an Oscar
Attached to my fuckin' name 
I might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor-
Made for me, say fuck it
Kick some shots back, get hammered, and nail her
These bitches tryin' to get attached, but they're failin'
To latch onto the tail of
My bumper, they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched
Yeah, I'm rich as a bitch
But bitches ain't shit, I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch, you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me: that's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swingin' at this chicks on-site
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul, but my dick's on strike
So all that love shit is null and void, bitch, I'm a droid
I avoid Cupid, stupid! Wasn't for blow jobs, you'd be unemployed
Oye-yoy-yoy, man-oh-man, your boy-boy-boy's
Gettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink-oink-oink
You fuckin' pigs, all you're good for is doink-doink-doink
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of 'em, I need a machine gun
I'll take 'em all out, I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, have a heart attack and just
Drop dead, and I'ma throw a fuckin' party after this, 'cause yes
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit
Just be a lot easier if you dropped dead?
I would feel so much better
I'm just playin', bitch
You know I love you
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout bustin' raps
And standin' for somethin': fuckin' acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what will happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon
Nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers
Nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, ‘cause—
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank
Maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck!
But I light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow
I'm stabbin' myself with a fuckin' knife in the gut
While I'm wipin' my butt
‘Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood
You're in a fight with a nut
‘Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle
Now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do: as soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue
I'm showin' you the flow no one do
‘Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
‘Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
‘Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem
Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, ‘cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, ‘cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
Tell me where to go
Tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say
No matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you
I used to be the type of kid
That would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
‘Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority, defiant often
Flyin' off at the handle at my mom
No dad, so I am noncompliant at home
At school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryin' to diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems
Thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalkin' up drawings
On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
To myself, either that or inside hidin' off in
The corner somewhere quiet, tryin' not to
Be noticed ‘cause I'm cryin' and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
‘Cause he said that I eye-balled him
And if you fall, I'll catch you there
I'll be your savior from all the wars
That are fought inside your world
Please have faith in my words
‘Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
‘Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'
‘Cause I obsess on everything in my mind, small shit
Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
Then split, but I don’t give a shit
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit, look on the bright side, at least I ain't walkin'
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame, then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me, life offers
Why bother even tryin' to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'?
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I want to say to the kid that said that I eye-balled him
Grab hold of my balls, like, "That's right, fight's on, bitch!"
Who woulda knew, from the moment I turned the mic on, that
I could be iconic in my conquest?
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
‘Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
‘Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit
Now you shut up, bitch, I am talkin'
Thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fuckin' worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins
‘Cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of Brian Baldingers
You're gon' die a ball licker, I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind, y'all can
Suck a dick; the day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exaltin' and I ain't haltin'
'Til I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me, and I'm the Fire Marshall, and this is my—
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy
Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped
To think that I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
It was like I blinked—sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous
‘Cause I was getting sick of this feelin'
Like I am always under attack, man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really thinking: "If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him."
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many people ever give a shit
What I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawing more attention toward it
‘Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, and I just zoned out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
It's like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out
‘Cause I was tryin' to leave, no doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history
Think they know now, because everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Thanks for the support, asshole! *scratch*
Thanks for the support, asshole!
Quit actin' salty! I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he round about
Dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, but goddamn, honky
That compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck is all this trash-talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my belt—word to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothin' else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare
So what if the insults are revoltin'?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest
And a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto before they put bath salts
And all those water bottles in Colorado, so get lost, Waldo!
My soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin'
A black hole, and I'm swallowin' this track whole
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac
In fact there they go tryin' to dip out the back-door retreatin'
‘Cause everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Holy mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed "ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin' magnets work?"
‘Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin' a joke, it's laughable
‘Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet
‘Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
Shorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
‘Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
‘Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
‘Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
But sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father
And I push it farther
So, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent
I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents
And motherfuckin' Father Time
It ain't never gonna stop a pessimist
Who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half alive
Poured my half empty glass in a cup
So now my cup has runneth over
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
I’m going back to what got me here
Yeah, cocky, and can’t knock being rude off, so fear not, my dear
And dry up your teardrops, I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, ‘cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em "Stick it!"
So sick I'm looking pale, wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
 all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
 all night long
 We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
‘Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho…
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
 all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
 all night long
 We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
‘Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berzerk, get your vinyls!
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick, word man, you heard
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
 all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
 all night long
 We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
‘Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah
"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings."
"But I'm only going to get this one chance."
"Something's wrong, I can feel it."
Six minutes. Six Minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
"Just a feeling I've got. Like something is about to happen, but I don't know what. If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; and if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances."
"You are just what the doc ordered."
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic 
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots, and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret
To rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since 
MC's get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bust a rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C. and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of 
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy
You're witnessing a massacre
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
"Oy vey, that boy's gay!", that's all they say, looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy
Hey, looking boy! What you say, looking boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, looking boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face, looking boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy, 'cause—
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton – no, Asgard, Asgard
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure, somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case, 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you, like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed 
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop," because I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use."
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to?
Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you!
I'm drunk – so Satan, take the fuckin' wheel!
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, and here's what they want from me
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons, make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard – be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?
Eminem has a full line of chainsaws
Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem
Marshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapper Eminem
"Who can say for sure? Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer. If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use, society would reap a great benefit."
I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of Tourettes
Fuck, fuck-fuck, can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbors' hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up, bitches
With these hedge-trimmin' scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous
It's the only way to escape this mess
And make the best of this situation, I guess
'Cause I feel like a little bitch
This predicament's despicable, I'm sick of just gettin' pushed
It's ridiculous, I look like a frickin' wuss
A pussy, this kid just took my stick of licorice
And threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was twelve and was six foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell; I got back up, all I did was book
Now there's using your head, Momma always said—
If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous
I'ma prove you wrong
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus
I'ma be the bomb
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Momma always said
"Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous."
Guess it pays to be brainless
Fast forward some years later, a teenager; this is fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat
I've accomplished, they've stomped me
Into the mud, gee, for what reason you stumped me?
But how do you get the shit beat out of you
Beat down and be upbeat when you don't have nothing?
No valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed
'Cause you're doomed from the start
It's like you grew up on Jump Street, from jump street
But if I could just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task, practicin' trash-talkin'
In a trance locked in my room
Yeah, but I got some plans, Momma
These damn rhymes are falling out of my pants pocket
I can't stop it, and I'm starting to blend in more
In school this shit helps for sure
I'm getting more self-assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore
I done put a stop to that, threw my first punch – end of story
Still, in my skull’s a vacant empty void
Been usin’ it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory: in this gourde there’s a Ford engine
Door hinge, syringe, an orange
An extension cord, and a Ninja sword
Not to mention four linchpins, an astringent stored
Ironin’ board, a bench, a wrench, a ore
Wench, an attention whore
Everything but a brain
But dome's off the fuckin' chain like an independent store
Something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't
'Cause I'd probably be Dahmer, 'cause Momma always said—
If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous
I'ma prove you wrong
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus
I'ma be the bomb
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Momma always said
"Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous."
Guess it pays to be brainless
Now my mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm
'Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb
I was on a bottom of the pile, gettin' stomped
But somehow I came out on top
I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, yo, fuck it, I'm out cold
Now everywhere I go they scream out go
I'm 'bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell-outs
Freak the hell out Middle America, hear 'em yell out
In terror, they were so scared
And those kids just about belted out
Whatever spouted or fell out
Of my smart aleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate? So be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Motherfuckin' difficult, ch-yeah
'Til then, hopefully you little homos
Get over your fears and pho-bias
It's okay to be scared straight
They said I provoke queers 'til emotions evoke tears
My whole career's a stroke of sheer genius
Smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You motherfuckin' 
Who the fuck woulda thunk that one little ol' MC'd
Be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it?
And boy, they did flock; can't believe this little hick locked
This hip-hop shit in his hip pocket, and still the shit got
That white-trash traffic in gridlock
Shit hoppin' like six blocks
From a Kid Rock/Insane Clown Posse concert in mid Oc-
-tober, and God forbid I see a wizard
And get a brain in my titanium cranium, y'all, 'cause
I'll turn into the Unabomber, Momma always said—
If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous
I'ma prove you wrong
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus
I'ma be the bomb
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Momma always said
"Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous."
Guess it pays to be brainless
Insaneness ain't even a word, you stupid fuck!
Neither is ain't
You used to say that I'd never be
Nothin' without you, and I'd believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze
And you'd laugh, and you'd tease
You're just fucking with me, and you must hate me
Why do you date me, if you say I make you sick?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was
A beautiful face is all that you have
‘Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothin', nothin' for me
So, please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was
You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide
That you caused, ‘cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde
Nah, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
‘Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
It's like you put a knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer!
‘Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left me
And left me with nothin' but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda had and we coulda been
But I'm breakin' out of this slump I'm in
Pullin' myself out of the dumps once again
I'm gettin' up once and for all – fuck this shit!
I'ma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin' punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
So don't lump me in with them chump-ions
I'm done bein' your punching bag
It was the November 31st today
Woulda been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
But couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay
And I thank you, ‘cause you made me
A better person than I was
But I hate you, ‘cause you drained me
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me, you're crazy
And after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
I may never trust someone
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that’s nothin'
Well, that’s nothin'
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
‘Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin' will do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff Van
Vonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that’s nothin'
Well, that’s nothin'
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it
And relates, that's great, it's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
Make that, straw into gold chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that’s nothin'
Well, that’s nothin'
I own a mansion but live in a house
A king-size bed but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mr. Brightside, glass is half-full
But my tank's half empty, gasket just blew
This always happens
Thirty minutes from home, gotta lay a log cabin
Only option I have's Mc
Donalds's bathroom
In a public stall, droppin' a football
So every time someone walks in the john I get maddened
"Shady, what up?" What? Come on, man, I'm crappin'
And you're askin' for my goddamn autograph on a napkin?
Oh, that's odd, I just happened
To run out of tissue, yeah, hand me that
On second thought I'd be glad then
"Thanks, dawg! Name's Todd, a big fan."
I wiped my ass with it
Crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and
Told him: "Todd, you're the shit," when's all of this crap end?
Can't pump my gas without causing an accident
Pump my gas, cut my grass, I can't take out the fuckin' trash
Without someone passin' through my sub, harassin'
I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow than bask sufferin' succotash
But the ant-acid, it gives my stomach gas
When I mix my corn with my fuckin' mashed
Potatoes, so what? Ho, kiss my country bumpkin ass!
Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is upper class?
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper
Tupperware in the cupboard, plasticware up the ass
Stuck in the past – i
Pod, what the fuck is that?
B-Boy to the core, mule, I'm as stubborn as
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on the city that made me
And 
They call me classless, I heard that, I second and third that
Don't know what the fuck I'd be doin' if it weren't rap
Probably be a giant turd sack
But I blew, never turned back
Turned 40 and still sag – teenagers act more fuckin' mature, Jack
Fuck you gonna say to me? I leave on my own terms, asshole
I'm goin' berzerk, my nerves are bad
But I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people, look at her dag
Her nylons are ran, her skirt's snagged
And I heard she drag-races, {burp} swag
Tuck in my Hanes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick  word, skag
We'd be the perfect match
'Cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
My apologies, no disrespect to technology
But what the heck is all of these buttons?
You expect me to sit here and learn that?
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?
Be an expert at computers?
I'd rather be an Encyclopedia Birtannica, hell with
Play
Station, I'm still on my first man on some Zelda
Nintendo, bitch! Run, jump, punch, stab, and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti
Put in on bread, make a sandwich with Welch's, and belch
They say this spray butter is bad for my health, but
I think this poor white trash from the trailer
Jed Clampett, Fred Sanford, and welfare
Mentality helps to keep me grounded
That's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I
Managed to dwell within these parameters
Still crammin' the shelves full of Hamburger Helper
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt, a
Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves, goddamn it, to hell, I
Can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I could yell, the
Other day someone got all elaborate
And stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings
I think my karma is catchin' up with me
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on the city that made me
And 
Got friends on Facebook all over the world
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
So, I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque
I'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked
I'm tryin' to be low-key, hopefully nobody notices me
In produce, hunched over, giant nosebleed
Ogre style as I mosey over to the frozen aisle
By the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova
The show's over, I'm hidin' in Kroger, buyin' groceries
He just had front-row seats
Told me to sign this poster, then insults me
"Wow! Up close didn't know you had crow's feet!"
I'm in the crossroads, lost, still shoppin' at Costco's
Sloppy Joe's, bulk waffles
Got caught picking my nose 
Look over, see these two hot hoes
Finger still up one of my nostrils
Right next to 'em, stuck at the light, the fuckin' shit's
Takin' forever to change, it's stuck, these bitches are lovin' it
Rubbin' it in, chucklin', couldn't do nothin'
Play it off, "What you bumpin'?"
"Trunk Muzik, Yelawolf's better," fuckin' bitch!
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up with
Another one, after Recovery was so highly coveted
But what good is a fuckin' recovery if I fumble it?
'Cause I'ma drop the ball if I don't get a grip
Hoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
Wrong subdivision to fuck with, bitch
Quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids
I love my city, but you pushed me to the limit – what a pity!
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's rainin' out
Kool-Aid stain on the couch, I'll never get it out
But bitch, I got an elevator in my house
Ants and a mouse – I'm livin' the dream!
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on the city that made me
And 
Something's burning, I can't figure out what 
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded; must
Just be the powder from the power of 
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon-to-be-spouse’s moan?
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
‘Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts – brace
Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo!"
‘Cause my head already goes to worst-case
Scenario, though in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory though
Shoulda known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Coulda made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
"No  you don't  under  stand
I  don't  do this for anyone ever."
Yeah, that ain't what they all say
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiancé
'Til you sucked on Wayne, André, and Kanye
Le
Bron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow Tha Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame
Guess I'm gettin' my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?
‘Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin'—
The game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love
She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah, she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her: 
And I told her: 
I told that bitch I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick
Suckin' dick in your momma tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fuckin' Ferris Wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on me – fuck you think, we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it
Or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day." Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singing, "I hope she's good enough"
Meanwhile you're chasin' her
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the—
The game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love
She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah, she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her: 
And I told her: 
So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché
It's all my fault anyway, she's turning the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together but forgot today was her b-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding, but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit comin' up
What the mother F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goddamn halt
Hit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racing at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried this stink ho in it, then pay to have the street repaved
 Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, ‘cause she's laying next to me in bed – directly aiming a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up
Like, "Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab."
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic
I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, "Hit the road" and after she left
I sent that bitch a text, I said, "Be careful driving
Don't read this and have an accident"
She glanced to look at it and wrecked
Too bad, thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oreal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytelling
While the whore was yelling, "Rape!"
'Til her vocal cords were swelling
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates and my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
Unless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date
Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of— 
"Wait, dinner at eight?", I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of—
Love, love, love, love
L-l, l-l-l-love
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
"Cleanin' Out My Closet" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you ‘cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever, we could drag this on and on, but
Agree to disagree, that gift for me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve
"Little prick, just leave!" Ma, let me grab my fucking coat
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close 
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house – it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house
The oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
‘Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though
‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Momma, for "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's taking over
And your mental state's deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear
Few may be as heavy as yours, but I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths
And I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a tribute
I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to get this off my chest
I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I'll always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life 
One without a cause 
So I'm coming home tonight
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life
Yeah, tryin' to figure out the difference
But I think the lines are starting to get blurred
I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimmin' every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
‘Cause I'm mentally rearrangin' his face
I need a change of pace
‘Cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger, and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey
And started slowly roasting 'em
‘Cause that's where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings! I feel like I play for the Saints
I just want to hurt you – aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanye's
Jay's, Wayne's and the Drake's
I'm frustrated ‘cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm going all out in this rap shit
And whatever the fallout is I'm strapped
For battle, sucka – duck, crawl out the back!
It's a bar fight, prepare your arsenal
And beware of bar stools flying through the air
And bottles breaking, mirrors also
And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full
"You done called every woman a slut
But you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall "
Oh, my bad, slut! And next time I show up to court
I'll be naked and just wear a lawsuit
Judge be like, "That's sharp
How much did that motherfucker cost you?
Smart-ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker!
You're so fuckin' gravy, Marshall, I should start calling you 'au jus'
‘Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo."
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I coulda changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic, K-Mart chains panic
‘Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
‘Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker
Shit, motherfucker, and these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screaming, "Fuck! Shit! Fuck!", adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out, I was like, "Merits?
Fuck that! I'd rather be loud, and I like swearing."
From the first album even the gals were like, "Tight lyrics!
Dreamy eyes!", but my fuckin' mouth was nightmare-ish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and
Opposition felt the opposite, sometimes I listen
And revisit them old albums often as I can and
Skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition
Ha ha! Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies
There's darkness closing in, there it goes again
It controls my pen, but that ain't me, it's my evil twin
But he's just a friend, who pops up now and again
So don't blame me, just blame him, it's my evil twin
Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time
So, who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber?
Nah, F with Christina!
I ain't fuckin' with either Jessica neither: Simpson or Alba
My albums just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Cloriseptic, Excedrin, Aleve, or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3's
Feel like I'm burning to death, but I'm freezin'
Bedridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again, like the legend of Heath-uh-
Ledger, my suicide notes, barely legible, read the
Bottom, it's signed by the Joker
Lorena said I never can leave her
She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit, bitch! Give up my dick for pussy?
I'd be Jerry Mathers I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off tryin' to mess with a cleaver
Golly-wally, I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden, it was definitely
My destiny when on the steps, I met De
Shaun
At Osborn, I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes
While I wrote rhymes, tryin' to get props for 'em
‘Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleeping, I made 'em stop snorin'
Made them break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip-hop in it's tip-top form
Since N.W.A was blaring through my car windows
Leaning on the horn, screaming "Fuck the police!" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top five, bitch, I'm top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an Evil Twin
So who the fuck do you think that third and that fourth spot's for?
And crazy as I am, I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again, who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that 
 please come in, what was your name again?
Hi! Faggot! Look who's back
With a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear, and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney, jeez, just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
‘Cause I'm so sick of being the truth
I wish someone finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh, LMFAO, no way, Jo-
Se Baez couldn't beat this rap – OJ, no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony, hey, ho
 I sound like I'm tryin' to sing
The fuckin' chorus to "Hip Hop Hooray"? No
I’m hollerin', you got bottom-end like an 8-0-
8 and I 'base' whether we're fuckin' off that instead of your face, so
Let your low end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho?! Slow dancing or bowling?
You tryin' to hold hands with your homie?
What, you think I'm looking for romance ‘cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a bo-ner
Superman, try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke, so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke ‘cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
‘Cause we are the same, bitch!
Used to get bent, now I represent to the fullest
Pencil is full of insolent bullets
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pitbull and a Rott'
Mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken
I begin to spittin' like vintage Pac
Demented, demonic, sinister
Ever since the Doc' replenished me
The day he gave me that shot when I was just about to quit
So to not see him with me would be a shocking image
And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
‘Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
And knock me to the canvas, even the boxing critics
Know that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish
Eat me brocoli, spinach, cocky? Nope
But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at
This and put emphasis on the "dope"
So when names come up, in that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow
You won't find anywhere
When it fires and I unload, my pen explodes
'Til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
Let insults fly every 60 seconds that go by, so you know I meant it
In school I was so shy, timid
Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member
Begging my mom for K-Mart Mc
Gregors
‘Cause they were new, St. Vincent de Paul
Those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
But kissed them old days, adiós, I did it
They said I was a gimmick
Now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Now you fuckers don't wanna go starting no argument
‘Cause you know I'll win it
Name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid
Rest in peace to Big Proof
You was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowing through me
I love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete
I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne
Better watch the fucking tone that you speak
Feel like I'm in the zone, I'm in a whole different league
On my motherfuckin' own, it's just me
No opponents can compete
And I've never been known to retreat
From beef, be beat, follow trends or wallow in defeat
I'm still hungry as fuck but can't even say "Bon appétit!"
‘Cause I don't know what to eat
Fucking microphone or the beat
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine
It's nose to the grindstone time, holmes, your mind's blown
‘Cause I rhyme like I'm still trying to get signed
Up in the Ebony Show-case
With Denaun screamin' "Who the fuck passed you the mic?"
Never asked you like my shit from the get
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
You had you a nice run, now take a hike
I ever meet my match, I'ma strike that bitch first
‘Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers
The real rappers get their motherfuckin' skills crackin'
Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?
You don't like it? Suck a cock! Almost forgot
Before I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down
‘Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so motherfuck Loud
They jerked me around, so what's up now?
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like
Rubbin' it in and holdin' some grudge now? But don't front
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid
Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe
But wear diapers, ‘cause you might leave a streak
I'm on a streak windshield wipers couldn't wipe
It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump into tonight
‘Cause I'm hyper or something
Needing someone or something is lighting
This fire under me, it's breathing new life
It's like I already died once
I guess some people only live twice, and it's funny
My days of being broke were so long ago
I lost all concept of money
But you dimes won't get a fucking nickle from me
Oh shit, I'm down on one knee
I'm having a stroke of genius – Elizabeth, I'm coming to you, honey
From boy to man
And still make a whore moan, like a thyroid gland
I'm in another category, man
Don't put me up with them pop stars
I never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band
No offense? Yes offense
Precedents has been set that'll never get met
Middle finger pressed against Moby's nose
Shouts to Obie, the curtains closed on my show
But never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it
You can't take it, oh
Got a whole generation of rappers coming up
That are nutty with the flow, but convince me you've heard
An MC since me who's as good with the fuckin' mincin' of words
Without mincin' words that'll make you feel like I'm pinchin' a nerve
Who's mentally disturbed
You might as well stick a knife in me and turn
It'll be like my skin being Indian burned
Hah, bitch, there isn't one, when will you learn?
Never been served, if memory serves
I'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words
You know I got you open kid, stop frontin'
You know I got you open, Word Life
One thousand different houses and Münchausen
I'ma make you wanna punch out some-fuckin'-one: "Ouch!
What the fuck you hit me for?!"
Scream "life" as I punch counter, in bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger in a dumb gown
Black hood with a scythe, shit, I'll laugh in his face, spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like, "Take this!
Now get your ass back in that game, bitch!
Don't take shit for granted, and don't take shit
Give it!" — only bull you should take is by the horns
A mixture of Whitey Ford and Mighty Thor
I everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writin', then record, replenish, keep writin' more
Nothing's ridin' on it but your pride, that's all you're fightin' for
So you bite, scratch, you claw, backs to wall
No one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls like they're gargantuan
And ask yourself how fuckin' bad you want it
Pull out your pass for whoopin' ass and flash it on 'em
Nobody's gonna back you in that corner, you're a hornet
No one's more ignorant than you fuckin' four in the mornin'
You're at the la-bor-atory
Stormin' like there's nothin' that's more important
Emcees, you better consider this a formal warnin', you're in for it!
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face?
I ain't finished, bitch, I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play, they say I'm a spoiled lil' baby, but—
Nobody puts a baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts a baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
What goes through an addict's brain
Besides static pain and Big Daddy Kane
Breakbeats and words? An erratic train
Of thought like splatter paint, scatter brain
Yeah, maybe that explains
Why you're back but you don't rap the same
And you're lookin' way thinner
'Cause your hunger got you lookin' like they took away dinner
 "Sugar Ray" Leonard
Wouldn't sugar-coat a fuckin' booger though
Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a  what?  GOAT
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
Hope it lands on another rap singer's lips who can't think of shit
Anything of wit that's interesting to spit
Yo, who's king of this fuckin' English lit?
Let your middle fingers flip on each hand while extending this shit
How low can you go?
Lower then Chuck D, ho, hear the bassiness
In my voice? Rocky's back, where's my Adrians?
Nobody's crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the Patriots to rap
I'm not a man, I'm a weapon
Who just happened to be a rapper
Who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany in the bathroom
I'd never be the same after
Now I'm back with an appe-tite for destruction
And a fuckin' recipe for disaster
So let's eat 'cause I'm famished
Every deed is a dastardly one
Evilish bastard, even you askin' for me to be po-lite
To people's like me havin' my teeth pulled
Nobody puts a baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts a baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
So step inside a dimension
Demented side of a mind that's like an inside of an engine
While I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded: if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper
You'd be the first one who finds him offensive
Got him climbin' the fences
Lost some time to addiction
But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary, I'm in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it, I'm an enigma
Fuck it, let's get to the meatballs, I'm gonna skip the
Veg and potatoes, edumacator
They are shit, legends are made of spit, treacherous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretched is what you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
Then combine 'em with Method Man and Redman
With metham-phetamines in his left hand
In his right is a sledgehammer
In pajamas, standin' in front of a webcam
Beatin' himself in the head 'til Russell lets him off Def Jam
Maybe I need my head examined
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hangin' from his ceiling, drippin' with a bed pan
I need meds, swear to God
'Cause if I go off the edge, T.I. ain't talkin' me off the ledge
Man, heart-throb, better fart, ah
Nah, more like a smart slob
Part Blob that'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject to the heart
And leave claw marks all over the Wal-Mart walls
Little baby with large balls
Fuck mud-slingin', I'm blood-flingin'
There's nothing on this fucking Earth
Better than bein' the king of the playground
I hate the swings, but I love bein' an underdog
'Cause when I'm pushed I end up swingin' 
Nobody puts a baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts a baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
Girl, you give me writer's block, I'm at a loss for words
Uhh, my mind's as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours
How much that cost? That's what I call the cost to splurge
You drive me bonkers, I’m about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' 'til I felt like Nas, the first
Date 'cause I think I gave you power
When I gave you flowers in a vase
A box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs
Probably shoulda never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Shoulda been one of the first signs to cause alert
Man, we jumped in too fast
'Cause since then I just can't be apart from her
'Cause nobody's body's awesomer
I lust it and she loves me 'cause I'm popular
But you know this ain't love
You know this ain't love, oh no
You know this ain't love, oh no
It's desperation 
It's desperation 
You were obviously oblivious to me
I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from
The beginning, now I'm in disbelief, I
Never knew that this could be such misery, ah
'Cause now you see nothing but me
And I don't see nothing but you
And I'm about to flip 'cause we are – super glued in
We stuck to each other's hips and we can't
Do anything individually, which is to cling on
Scared to be alone, can't specifically describe it
I just can't seem to give a reason
This definitive, just need ya
Talkin' about I live and breathe ya
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically
Addicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you
Don't wanna be with you neither
Bitch, put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek
'Cause this ain't love
You know this ain't love, oh no
You know this ain't love, oh no
It's desperation 
It's desperation 
Just want you to myself
Don't wanna share you with no one else
"What the fuck you whisperin' for?
You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it's time that we just split and leave the
Games behind, your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
I think you need to finish developing a
Little more mentally to get the picture."
That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the keys up
To the crib ever again, no reason
Not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
You better have an epiphany, slut
Guess what? The lease up
I'm just mad the time it took to discover
You were usin' me for loot like I used you for looks
Oh, thought you was too good for me, huh?
Yeah, toots, used to be my Carrie Underwood
I was your lumberjack
But I can't stomach this, I'm leavin' you, I'm not comin' back
She said, "The fuck with that!
Where's my Louisville Slugger at?"
She grabbed that fuckin' bat
And swung it at my head, I barely ducked and that's
Right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
Steel toe, girl probably coulda put a 100-yard field goal
Through the uprights
You know this ain't love, oh no
You know this ain't love, oh no
It's desperation 
It's desperation 
"What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare."
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
'Til one day I grew suspicious
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start anew, but ditchin'
Missouri for Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone, put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom, please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are Krypton-ite
So the walls, I done lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into 'em, runnin' through the kitchen
Pretendin' to be blind Superman, 'cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though, I could turn into Invisible Kid
Disappear out of sight like a true magician
And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new but different
Music into the picture, and it became my new religion
"I remember it clearly, even today."
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Nan
Always itchin' for somethin' to do, was flippin'
Through the radio stations one day
And discovered this DJ who was mixin'
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the Wizzard
You ain't have a fuckin' clue what you was missin'
I'd zone out with my headphones
All I remember doing's wishin' for shoes
Fuck them stupid Pumas, bitch!
It's all about them new edition Troops
You get them LL Cool J coolin' system
Made that final maneuver to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this
That's how I knew my mission
Little boom box boomin', spittin'
Practicin' numerous writtens
When I'd sit in my room, envisionin' my dreams come to fruition
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit
He'd go cuckoo ballistic, go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us too existed
To do this shit; never quit, too persistent
"We are the underground empire."
Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition
If we all band together, there ain't no stoppin' this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
If you got dissed at the Shop, 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin'
You, and you forgot your written
Opportunity knocks once, it ain't knockin' again
It tried ding-dong ditchin' shit, I fuckin' got that bitch in
A headlock, cut off his oxygen, Slim
Is not budgin' like cocksuckin' cynderblocks in the wind
Now I got a pot to piss in
Spot in that top position, koppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's pissin', leg up on the competition
Promisin' complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' 'em
Probably end up on top of 'em
Stompin' 'em like Ndamukong
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian, La
Dainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle, bitch, I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words
Is loose, but you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts – shit, no wonder you're sore losers!
Now where's your poo, birds?
Ooh, no more trippin' in bird shit
Songs of self-empowerment surgin'
Words of encouragement, but discouragin'
The rappers, the rap game's god
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
Since yours ain't workin' out, each verse is
More merciless than the first is
And you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this bitch
To get served, bloodthirst revenge of the nerds, chka
"That you'll not escape my vengeance."
And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
Word to Uncle Ron, I'm turnin' into a non-humble Don
You blind dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on
So start the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on
Better back away from the front row, get launched
Show you I'm bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo
On the fuckin' Jumbotron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble, you bomboclaats
I'll leave you stretched out like a fuckin' yawn
So mow the fuckin' lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fuckin' up this whole landscape of rap
The G.O.A.T. just ate eight acres, an eighth of that
Was just to make a path
And take it straight to your favorite rapper
Oh, look, my notebook looks smoke-cooked
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
Charred debris floatin' like Oakwood
Was burnin', return of the no good and I won't quit
"And the next thing I know
Something came crawling up from below
Something that made Godzilla look like a plane."
And I don't quit, won't change
It's like a Groundhog's Day
So crowd around, y'all, 'cause you may
See if I popped your head
I'm a monster
I'ma turn into a monster
I'm a monster
With my dick in your mouth all day!
"I'm not so sure I want to know from whence it came
But the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
There, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing."
I can feel the heat risin'
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder
Of why we can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, ‘cause—
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Yesterday was the tornado warning
Today's like the morning after: your world is torn in half
You wake in its wake to start the mourning process
And rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter
It's like an enormous asthma
Thunderstorm has passed ya
You weathered it and poked its eye out
With the thorn bush that you used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is
Stuffed, so focused on the bright side
Then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But every day is a new learning curve
As you steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve, but you have to
To avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
‘Cause they hurt you so bad
It's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket
But you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past
Standing in the inferno and chant—
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
You're so familiarized
With what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died
‘Cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive, which means you will survive
Although today you may weep ‘cause you're weakened
And everything seems so bleak and
Hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in; that's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good
That you're willing to forgive 'em
Even after all the shit you been put through, this feeling
Of resilience is building, and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in, but you're fireproof
Flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin'
You look down, ‘cause you're so over 'em
You could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling
As time passes, things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remain the same
But tomorrow, today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze
So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this livin' hell
Still a little piece of you dies as you scream—
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine
Not with fists, but with wings that I will fly
And I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers'? It's a rare condition
It's what you're sufferin' from when you simply don't care if it's an
80 degree day and there's no frickin' air conditionin'
And you can't see the bitch’s hair is frizzin'
'Cause you got the windows up, blarin' the system
In your Chevrolet Prizm
The devil ain't on a level same as him
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And imagine him givin' an adjective an ass-whoopin'
So bad they should put his ass in prison
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs
Like they did somethin' to me personally
Used to get bullied, so I'd cut class and ditch it
Now I bully rap, I'm the shit, faggot 
Cadillac from a K Car
My ass from a hole in the ground, still can’t tell 'em a-part
Came straight out the trailer park
Screamin' I'm proud to shop at K-Mart, and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart, arguin' over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin', I don't give a fuck, I don't play
Bitch, you think you saw this basket first?
You're ass backwards like motherfuckin' Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
Ripped a gapin' hole in it, flipped out
Ripped down the drapes, tied 'em around my neck
Went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Slipped, fell straight down to the ground
Splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell, got impaled by the gates
Saw Satan, stuck his face in an ashtray
While I sashayed around flames with a match
And I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothin' to do with a scale
Or being gay, little faggot, but by the way
Thoughts are gettin' darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey
Tyler the Creator, and Violent J
It's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face
I'm insane, every rhyme I say
Sons you like an ultra-violet ray
I’m sellin' hatred, buffet style, all the shit you can eat
$11.99, so come on and pile a plate!
I’m throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I’m spittin' while I’m shittin' on competition
In the meantime it’s always mean time, I'm gettin'—
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I’ve been a career asshole
I don’t see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit
I was born a mistake, but I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose
Was to beat a beat purplish, slaughter tracks
I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
I’m comin' to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong, the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
'Cause that cougar's a MILF
She's the oldest trick in the book, but I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'ma snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed woulda caught a flat
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid
Indigestion, my suggestion’s Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm runnin' away with the game
It's 'cause I am, don't speculate, spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by with my wicked ways
Lady, you can suck a dick 'til your neck aches
Cry 'til you get puffy eyes, red faced
But I'm leavin' on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
And I'm sick of poundin' a square peg in a round hole
Sorry, another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gon' fit in my storage overhead space
'Cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words: don't try to put your heart in a headcase
'Cause baby, stable mentally I ain't
I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me, I think my face is melting
If you felt these migraines
And see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
If you read my mind, you can see my pain
And you'd see why I be this way
Ever since I was knee-high playin' with G.I. Joes
Told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game
'Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Like a fuckin'  echo 
 Psycho on a cyclone cycle, spiralin', here I go
I'm outta control like no other mic go
Stab you 'til the knife goes – dull
I'm nothin' but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
'Cause I'ma sock it to you!
Dyke ho, you don't like it?
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle
And ride it like a motorbike
I'm finna blow the mic the whole night, so
Strike up the fuckin' maestro, I'm nitro
And hi, ho, hand me my shovel!
I'm liable to dig my hole deeper
And it's off to H-E double hockey sticks, I go
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
Ohh, please be empty
Please be empty, please be empty
Thank you, God!
Shit… Is that a girl?
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth
And get my balls blew out, and get gay into the A.M.
And lay with eighteen guys naked
And let myself show, let myself show
Buttfuck it, suck it, pull it, tug it
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
So everybody, everybody
Circle jerk, touch my body
Who is that? Where are you going? Come back!
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? Fuck you then!

Do you wanna, do you wanna be
Do you wanna, do you wanna be
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
Free from pain, free from scars
Free to sing, free from bars
Free my dawgs, you're free to go
Block is hot, the streets is cold
Free to love, to each his own
Free from bills, free from pills
You roll it loud, the speakers blow
Life get hard, you ease your soul
It cleanse ya mind, learn to fly
Then reach the stars, you take the time
To look behind and say, "Look where I came
Look how far I done came"
They say that dreams come true
And when they do, that there's a beautiful thing
Now do you wanna, do you wanna be happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be free
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be
Rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
Yeah
The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas, here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
In terms of the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossed in the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts
And then get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing
Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low
What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights
Cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me cause I  love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide, it's just physics
Please let's put our egos aside, you my niggas
And should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights fulla Hennessey
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas sun
Yeah I said 'sun'
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track, nigga
Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low
I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the God
Nah you ain't the God
Nigga, Cole the God 
January 28th
Make a million dollars off a rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
I wanna make a million dollars of a rap tune
I'm gonna make a million dollars off a rap tune
Cole, Cole world, yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' like that
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
‘Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it
If she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin', but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said "You ever had sex before?"
Damn…
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I wrote back and said
"Of course I had sex before," knowin' I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby," knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But she don't know that
So she done wrote back and told me
"Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'"
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked
When you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like, "Yeah, baby, sound like a plan"
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin, fuck
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
You know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm prayin', "God, don't let me bust quick"
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on, how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin', and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
It's time for action: pull out the condoms real smooth
Yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
And said, "I wanna get something off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause…"
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I grew up, a fucking screw up
Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I won't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm trying to stay alive
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I? Aye who am I?
Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
I get high cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see
I always did shit the hard way
My nigga Squirrel slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch
And he gon' get it right back
I peep game
Got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let em' hit the blunt though
I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, "What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on," he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, "Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn’t my mans
I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me
And show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Aye who am I?
Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
I get high cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see
I never felt better
Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
Guess not! 
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know?
How could you know? How could you know?
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gon' circle round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream
It'll haunt you nigga, haunt you
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?
Guess not! 
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure
Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure
My inhibition's fighting my intuition
Premature premonition, showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!
BLAOOOW!
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it
Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?
We all kings
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
The reality, he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
It's for all the kings
Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved
Roll up and smoke my sins away
I'd like to go to St. Tropez
Maybe I'll go, maybe I'll stay
Maybe I'll stay
She asked me if I'm scared to fly
To tell the truth, I'm terrified
I never been that high before
Very bad reason not to go
Terrible reason not to go
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Ay from the door I showed you my scars
And I told you girl, "I won't lie"
If we at war, then this is a war that I can't afford, no I, I, I
I wanted more but that was before
Lord knows I'm torn, so I–I cry 
From the corner of my eye, baby
It's been hard for me to smile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Hollywood Cole, go
Ay Hollywood, ay Hollywood Cole, go
My nigga done went Hollywood
You wanna know just where I'm at, well let me tell you 'bout it
I put my city on the map but let me tell you 'bout it
They tryna say I can't come back, ay let me tell you 'bout it
Man fuck them niggas I come back, ay let me tell you 'bout it
I wanna tell you 'bout it: hands up, everybody run
Cole outside and he say he got a gun
Niggas like "Man that's what everybody said"
Go and pop the trunk and everybody dead
Everybody scared of the nigga, aware that the nigga is better
All my bitches the pick of the litter, never bitter
Niggas is fake, they anime
Me I never hate, get cake like Anna Mae, woah
Eat the cake bitch, eat the damn cake
Fuck good, nigga, we demand great
Order Domino's and she take off all her clothes
Nigga you know how it goes, make the pizza man wait
The best kept secret
Even Hov tried to keep it and I leaked the damn tape
Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Secret service couldn't keep the man safe
I said to the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan' be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me
Get off my dick, woah
Get off my dick, woah
Get off my dick, bitch, woah
Get off my dick woah
Man fuck them niggas I come home and I don't tell nobody
They gettin' temporary dough and I don't tell nobody
Lord will you tell me if I changed, I won't tell nobody
I wanna go back to Jermaine, and I won't tell nobody
Young nigga never had love
You know, foot massage, back rub shit
Blowing bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' bout some kids, still I
Tell them hoes come through 
Get to know somebody and you really learn a lot about 'em
Won’t be long before you start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breathe without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie it's just 1 thing about 'em
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more, no more
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
But every nigga in the club singing
To the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan' be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me
Get off my dick
But every nigga in the club singing
Singing this song yeah
Got all the bitches in the club singing
Singing this song yeah
And all they mamas let their kids sing it
Sing this song yeah
The baby mamas and the mistresses
Sing this song yeah, song yeah
Song yeah, song song yeah
 This shit is retarded, goddamn
Why every rich black nigga gotta be famous
Why every broke black nigga gotta be brainless
Uh, that's a stereotype
Driven by some people up in Ariel Heights
Here's a scenario
Young Cole pockets is fat like Lil Terrio
Dreamville, give us a year we'll be on every show
Yeah, fuck nigga I'm very sure, heh
Fuck the rest, I'm the best nigga out
When I'm back home I'm the best in the South
When I'm in LA I'm the best in the West
You contest? You can test, I'mma stretch niggas out
Oooh I'mma stretch niggas out
That go for all y'all if I left niggas out
This shit for everbody on my testicles
Please make sure you put the rest in your mouth, ho
First things first: Rest In Peace Uncle Phil, for real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'mma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga...
One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch; not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up and tell her
"Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'mma stay for good"
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it"
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me
One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood, bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck em then we kick em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap, she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt
'Fore she leave—I'mma need my shirt back
Nigga, you know how it go
One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas—probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once—shame on—shame on you. Fool me—you can't get fooled again
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow, but the pussy deep 
She shallow, but the pussy deep 
She shallow, but the pussy deep 
She shallow, but the pussy deep 
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes 2 now
Oh what do I do now?
Cause if we ever got together
I'd have to be them niggas step-pops forever
And well that ain't my thing cause I
I ain't even got my own
And I ain't really got no home
No place to put these things I own
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the games you used to play
And I thought about that little kid
And I thought about the things we did
I always thought that we would be together
I always knew that we would be together
But I don't wanna wait forever
I don't wanna wait forever
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello?
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Everything's so sad when you look back
On the rebound like a book back
On the rebound like a put back
Don't just sit back, bitch get on it
Time fly by way too quick don't it
Reflection bring regrets don't it
Rejection makes you defensive
So you protect your pride with your reflexes
But life is a game with no reset on the end
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It's all good
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It's all good
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes 2 now
Oh what do I do now?
Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl
Damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways
Because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I
Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga—uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, "Thanks for the view", waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like boing on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I
Love yourz
Love yourz
No such thing
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleeping on your level cause it's beauty in the struggle nigga
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle nigga
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas down the block
Man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches listen this is what you'll find
The good news is nigga you came a long way
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosening
Quick, do something before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of living with demons
Cause they always inviting more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there living in debt
Cashing minimal checks
Turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And that's a nigga who was once in your shoes
Living with nothin' to lose
I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes
That's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive
And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter, it don't matter
I don't mind cause you don't matter
I don't mind cause I don't matter
You'll see in the end
I've got a feeling that there's somethin' more
Something that holds us together
Something that holds us together
The strangest feeling but I can't be sure
Something that's old as forever
Something that's old as forever
Love, love, love, love
And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter, it don't matter
I don't mind cause you don't matter
I don't mind cause I don't matter
You'll see in the end

And the only way you gon' get to that happiness is through love, real, geniuine, motherfuckin' love man. Not the fake shit, not the Hollywood shit, not the niggas giving you props so you think you the shit. Not motherfuckers knowing you so you think you famous. Not niggas seeing your whip and they want your whip so you feel good cause they want your whip. Or they want your bitch, so you feel better, fuck that, real love.

Fuck y'all, but I love y'all at the same time man...

It was back in '07 did a couple of tapes
Did a couple DVDs, made a couple mistakes
Didn't know what I was doing but I put on the cape
Now it's, "Which world tour should I go on today?"
See you told me I would lose but I won
I might cop a million Jimmy Choo's just for fun
Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me Australia, Sydney
Might run up in Disney out in LA with Lindsay
Got the eye of the tiger, the Lion of Judah
Now its me and my time, it's just me in my prime
Everything I tried to teach 'em they gon' see it in time
Tell them bitches get a stick I'm done leading the blind
Got two shows tonight that's Brooklyn and Dallas
Then a private party at the Buckingham Palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie no commercial
That's Young Money, Cash Money yeah I'm Universal
I hear they comin' for me because the top is lonely
What the fuck they gon' say
What the fuck they gon' say
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best
I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch
Now I'm sitting at the closing, bought my mother a house
You could never understand why I grind like I do
Micaiah and Jelani why I grind like I do
Cause even when my daddy was on crack I was crack
Now the whole album crack you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door, all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win
Cause before they could begin, you told them it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick I'mma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breathe 'til I motherfucking say so
To all my bad bitches: I could see your halo
It's okay
It's okay
Long as you know
Long as you know
Long as you motherfuckers know
I'm the best, best, best, best
I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up; flatscreen
Plasma
"Hey Nicki, hey Nicki," asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars; sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho; punt
Forced trauma; blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' brag-a-lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie; camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch!
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut!
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering "Why, God?"
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain’t finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an i
Pod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch 
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
I told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
"Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill; mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck; overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning Eli
Manning Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning Eli!!
All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You had the same passion that I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's  meets 
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Roman, Roman! Stop it, stop it!
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady!
What's going on? They'll lock you away!
They'll put you in a jail cell! I promise!
Take your mother's warning, Roman, please
Back to bed! Run along! Let's go! Come on!

If I had a dick, I would pull it out and piss on 'em

Broke bitches so crusty 
Gave the bitch a ride, got the Continental dusty
Trust me, I keep a couple hundred in the duff-b
Couple wet wipes case a bum try to touch me 
I'm the terminator
Bitch talk slick I'mma have to terminate her
These little nappy headed hoes need a perminator
You my seed, I spray you with the germinator
Move back, bugs
Matter fact, you know, the queen could use a back rub
If you could turn back time - Cher
You used to be here but now you gone - Nair
Shitted on 'em, man I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em

How do you do that shit?
How do you? How do you? How do you?
How do you? How do you?
You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin, you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice, I always hated
But lookin back, it made me greater
You always told me, forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'
It's like you got it, down to a science
Why am I tryin'? No you ain't buyin
I tried to fight it, back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
From yellin' at you, and gettin' at you
Pickin up dishes, throwin' them at you
Why are you speakin', when no one asked you?
You see right through me
How do you do that shit? How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you? How do you? How do you?
How do you? How do you?

How do you do that shit? How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit? How do you? Do that
How do you? Do that
How do you? Do that
How do you? Do that
How do you? Do that
What are we doin'? Cause you see through me
Cause you say "Nicki," and I say "Who me?"
And you say "No you," and I say "Screw you"
Then you start dressin', and you start leavin'
And I start cryin', and I start screamin'
The heavy breathin', but what's the reason?
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin', I'm askin' you somethin - yo!
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin', passive aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay you're right, just let it go
Okay you got it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You could turn a free throw to a goal
Nigga got the peephole to my soul
You see right through me
How do you do that shit? How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you? How do you? How do you?

How you do that Baby
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, To fly
I wish today it would rain all day
Maybe that'll kind of make the pain go away
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Prayin' but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah its strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got they guns out aimin' at me
But I become Neo when they aimin' at me, me, me
Me against them, me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start comin' and I start risin'
Must be surprisin', I'm just surmisin'
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher, more flya'
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, To fly
Everybody wanna' try to box me in
Suffocatin' everytime it locks me in
Paintin' their own pictures then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
Caus' I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that could ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation, I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear, that is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear, and I ain't got no muthafuckin' time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard your nays become yays
Yankee stadium with Jays and Kanyes
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, To fly
Get ready for it, get ready for it, get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it, get ready for it, get ready for it
I came to win
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, To fly
I drove for miles just to find you and find myself
All these screams all these voices in my head
You gave me strength, gave me hope for a lifetime
I never was satisfied
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself given' up, given' up
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself given' up, given' up
Given' up, given' up, given' up
It's not your fault I'm a bitch, I'm a monster
Yes, I'm a beast, and I feast when I conquer
But I'm alone on my throne all these riches
I came this way, all this way just to say, ay
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself given' up, given' up
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself given' up, given' up
Given' up, given' up, given' up
I'm given up baby, yes
It feels like I've been drivin' for miles 
And I can't seem to silence these voices in my head
Come save me 
Come save me
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself given' up, given' up
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself given' up, given' up
Given' up, given' up, given' up
I fly with the stars, in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live, doesn’t mean you’re alive
Don’t worry bout me, and who I fire
I get what I desire, it’s my empire
And yes I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water, upon a vampire -
In this very moment, I’m king
In this very moment, I slayed Goliath  -
With a sling,this very moment I bring
Put it on everything, that I will retire with the ring -
And I will retire with the crown, Yes!
No, I’m not lucky, I’m blessed,Yes!
Clap for the heavyweight champ, Me!
But I couldn’t do it all alone, We!
Young Money raised me,grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens and it’s crazy
Cause I’m still hood, Hollywood couldn’t change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn’t faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated,best believe that  -
When we're done, this moment will be syndicated, I don't know - This night, just reminds me of -
Everything that they deprived me of  -
P-P-P-P-Put ya drinks up!
It’s a celebration, every time we link up
We done did everything, they can think of
Greatness, is what we on the brink of
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin’ married today
And now you bitches that be hatin' can catch the bouquet, oh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide
I can’t believe we really made it, I’m partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man!
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man!
I’m really tryna make it more than what it is
Cause everybody dies but not everybody lives!
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
This is my moment, I waited all my life, I can just tell it's time
Drifting away, I’m one with the sunsets, I have become alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive, alive

Feels like I’m–
How could it be, little me
Had the power to be the best B, in the league
Yeah inevitably, but could it belittle me?
You was heckling me, now it’s monotony winning regularly
I catch rec on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations
Bitches ain't got it in ‘em, I kill ‘em and then I skin ‘em
The contract was signed but I am the addendum
So wh-where my dawgs at, Randy
Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy
Ca-ca-ca-cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me nooooow, I dare you, Bambi
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show

Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like Le
Bron
Ahh, ha hahahaha ha
I’m the best now, anybody with some money should invest now
Soccer moms need to organize a pep rall’
You game over bitch, Gatorade, wet towel
Mothafuckers ain't ready, they neva' been

Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine!
I fly, I fly high, I’m blazing, I’m blazing, feels like I’m blazing

This is the moment, grab your Kodak
While I’m flying with a flow that is
The greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan
And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder
And the lights even brighter, baby stand next to my fire
Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah
‘rari six hundred horses, that’s my chariot of fire?
Where we flying, they can’t find us all them broke days behind us
I just took your whole life and redesigned it
I think I’m Marc Jacobs, I think I’m Lagerfeld
I think without makeup, you still bad as hell
I'mma grab your waist then, I'mma grab your face and
Then I'mma taste it, then I'mma blaze it
Hello all my bad girls, this just in Yeezy hurt the beat
Like he fucked her best friend and she let him back in
And he just did it again, He crazy, he blazin, he off the deep end
I’m blazin’, I’m flagrant, I'm crazy I’m saying
Too much for the World so they abbreviate him
His past is her fav, his stats is amaze
Her dress is just per’ uhh
Prada coloured beige
It obvi’ we the ish and I’m rolling with my Brits
So real, you so trill, baby everything legit
How you feel? They say we crazed 'cause our styles so diff’
They'll be jeal' when we in the mag looking magnif’

Fuck these background niggas I was tryna ad-lib
Add this, we blazin’
Nicki what you think? I got two White Russians but we also need some drinks
Why is that you could only see the worst in me?
I swear sometimes it feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real, it's kinda hurtin' me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'ma just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mercedes
And I might pop a couple of them Percocets
Yeah, that'll make me transform to Hercules
I am who I am, uh!
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
I am who I am, uh!
I swear to God man, everything in life is old
And the only thing that changed is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife I'ma fight your soul
Cause the second time around I'll be twice as bold
So do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold 'till death do us part?
Cause if not it's just best we both part
Cause how am I supposed finish what you start?
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe
Then you say I won't survive if I leave
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve
I no longer need your attention, at ease
It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman hear me roar
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
Maybe you died cause everybody ask me, "Where you at?"
I try to channel you in hopes that I could steer you back
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waitin' tell me you ain't six feet under
And tell me that you comin' back and you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake
In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
Cause it was you who talked me down from jumping off the ledge
Your earings bamboo, your long nails too
Your BMW everytime you came through
You was the braveheart,you stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up, you played the same part
But I needed to grow, and I needed to know
Were there some things inside of me, that I needed to show
So I just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back
You told me, you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that
Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour, money, fame, and power?
Cause if so, that will forever go down my lamest hour
I should've kept you with me, gettin' at them nameless cowards
They was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hoped you understood
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground, and I was mainstream
I live the life now, that we would daydream
My only wish, is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came yeah, tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us, when we was just on some stupid shit
And it's still fuck the media they ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back
And yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that
And yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that
Shorty I'ma only tell you this once, you the illest
And for your loving I'ma die hard like Bruce Willis
You got spark, you, you got spunk
You, you got something all the girls want
You're like a candy store
And I'm a toddler
You got me wanting more and more of
Your love, your love 
He the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a doo-rag, keep the wave on swim
W-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
'S' on my chest cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to give up on anybody who plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me mama, lil mama, I call him baby
Shorty I'ma only tell you this once, you the illest
And for your loving I'ma die hard like Bruce Willis
You got spark, you, you got spunk
You, you got something all the girls want
You're like a candy store
And I'm a toddler
You got me wanting more and more of
Your love, your love 
He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band
Just left Money Gram in the lemon Lam'
Hot damn make me scream like Summer Jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway I think I met him in the sky
When I was a Geisha he was a Samurai
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
'S' on my chest let me get my cape on
He's so thugged out - Ghostface and Raekwon
"Konvict" just like Akon
Cause you know the Snitches be putting the Jake on
Shorty I'ma only tell you this once, you the illest
And for your loving I'ma die hard like Bruce Willis
You got spark, you, you got spunk
You, you got something all the girls want
You're like a candy store
And I'm a toddler
You got me wanting more and more of
Your love, your love 
Find me in the dark
I'll be in the stars
Find me in your heart
I'm in need of your love
I could've been had fame
Jump shot with a stupid ass aim
Cause you couldn't get around the last name
So my cross-over wins the last game
And it's ill right?
Switched up the flow but it's still right
Go back to that, yeah I still might
I'mma just do me when it feel right
You could bring it anyday

—I get it in though
No sexual innuendo
Nobody that I could just depend on
Until I touch down in the end zone
And then they come out like roaches
P-p-pecking away like vultures
But little did they know, distribute the payroll
Pick out the outfit, pick out the single
Sadly, I'm so business savvy
Similar protocol but the tidbits vary
Never been like me, ain't never been like this
My flow's a crisis they screamin' high pitch
Gun cock, pause—
And I'm well aware of the gun laws
Tell 'em, that I'm gunnin' for the top, Forbes

Yeah, this is my last chance 
Then shoot, I'm ready to shoot

Thinkin' we was on, you tellin' me we off
Yourwhole vibe changed, when you got that phone call

And your game always makes me concur
And maybe I should have never, taken you from her
But, with all of the aforementioned, I am still trapped, in your dimension
So I will be on the mountain waitin', cause I am in need, of more attention
Could've called back, just to say somethin',I'mma fall back in the bass drum
Please come to destination,I'm not doing well, exclamation!

She got that good good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, or her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave
I like the way you walking if you walking my way

Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I'll let you be the judge, and-and-and I'm the case

Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock
Oh, I can make your bed rock
Okay, I get it, let me think, I guess it's my turn
Maybe it's time to put this pussy on your sideburns
He say I'm bad, he prob'ly right

I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike
Be on my low starch, be on my egg whites
He say, "Nicki don't stop, you the bestest"
And I'd just be coming off the top, asbestos
I love your sushi roll, hotter then wasabi
I race for your love, "Shake'n Bake" Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W, but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back, cause I'm not just anybody
I seen em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was your girl? I thought I recognized her
Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock
Oh, I can make your bed rock
She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters, and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: "Don't you ever show this!"
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said "Your words get me open"
So I closed it. Where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment
She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless
Well, that's what you are, how I see it is how I call it
Yeah, look, look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain’t leavin' fast, I'mma stay awhile
Hold your head, Chris, I-I'mma take it down!
I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is lagging
See me in that new thing, bums is gagging
I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been
Yeah, I said it, has-been, hang it up, flatscreen
Plasma, hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencing
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cutting it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fucking with
You lil' Fraggle Rock, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
I eat your face off
You niggas sweet as pie like this is a bake-off
I love Nicki's curves, swing at the baseball!
 I'll beat your brakes off
Hi, I'm Tune, salt in the wound
I'm up in this bitch - pardon the goons!
Throw dirt on the floor get caught in the broom
I like a big wet pussy with a fork and a spoon
I got the money and the power, a woman in the shower
And she don't want nothing but my Johnson - Howard
Sour Dies in the Swisher Sweet - sweet and sour
You're scared? Go to church, say your prayers, read a Bible
Ah! I don't know what y'all on - please
I go in like "goin"
Drink in my hand with the world in the other
The Uzi go "brrrr" - stutter
Life is a puzzle - jigsaw
All I do is win - my name should be "Victor"
Haha! Old-ass rappers
I'm still the shit! Old-ass Pampers
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Foie gras, I hear you ducks is quackin
I was just dumpin my ashes, I'mma puff it and pass it
I'm a fuckin assassin, you should jump in the casket!
Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'mma wrap your coffin with a bow
"Nicki, she's just mad cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shitting, then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear them mumbling, I hear the cackling
I got 'em scared, shook, panicking
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfucking boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas getting buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches calling me Manning Eli
Manning Eli, these bitches calling me Manning Eli!!
Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, "Accept yourself"
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
This the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before
Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
Yeah yeah, this the shit I wanna go out to
Started…
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team fuckin' here
I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my momma's house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin' me, like, "Where you at?
I gave you the keys, told you bring it right back.”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show, and we—
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house
Cause we—
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stayed the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stayed the same through the money and the fame
Cause we—
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
Own it
It's yours
It's yours
Yours... You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit
Go and own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, you own that shit, go and
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit
Go and own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, you own that shit, go and
Niggas talk more than bitches these days 
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry"
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
Cause you got the Batphone and my workline, you should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time? You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's... it's always gonna be yours
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, it's yours, it's yours, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, baby, own it, it's yours, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit
Worst...
Mothafucka never loved us
Fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit...
Niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'...
Nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
'Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish
Just to see am I finished
On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up!
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior
Hold up, hold my phone
Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done grown up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything
When it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch, you better have my money
When I come for that shit like O.D.B
On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up!
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior
Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior
Remember? Remember? Mothafucka, remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka, remember? Worst behavior
What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, cause...
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
Thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
"Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G
Been a East Side ting
Scarborough ting from time, G
Been have up di ting dem from time, G
So I don't know what's wrong with these
Little wasteman out here eh?
Y'all need to know yourself."
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we're going home 
Just hold on, we're going home 
It's hard to do these things alone 
Just hold on, we're going home 
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we're going home 
Just hold on, we're going home 
It's hard to do these things alone 
Just hold on, we're going home 
"There’s 3 balls and a strike. Here's the pitch. It's belted deep to center, Revere goes back, jumps at the wall, and it's gone!"
Isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with "this time will be different"
Oh, the idea is fun, oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time
Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby
Yeah, swanging
She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say: "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around
Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby
I'll be here, just swanging
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road in the east end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I'll be there just swangin'
I treat you good girl like you're famous
I know I'm late it's always the same shit
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'm on the road right now swangin, girl
I don't know why they been lyin'
But your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statements just look like
I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum!
I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And fuck it, man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit
That's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny, you don't even know
'Bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with you back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Famous and dangerous, you understand me?
Showtime, headlines, big time
Sunshine, tote 9's, bust mines
Flatline, hard grind, high life
Stay fly, it's jet time – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Swag on head to feet nigga – stunt, nigga!
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it
Drop down, drop-drop 
Drop down, drop-drop
Drop down, drop-drop, get it, get it
Drop down, drop-drop
Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear that I get it, I get it, I get it
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We so far from finished, I brought you right back just so we can relive it
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
Your hustle don't ever go unnoticed baby, I'm with you I'm with it
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
They don't work hard as you, damn that's so crazy
At the end of the night when you count, numbers don't lie to my baby
Locker room full of money, girl you just did it
I get it I get it, man fuck all that talking, take shots to the kidney
Down payment on the Jaguar, your roommate got credit
12 months on the lease, that's a come up baby don't you ever forget it
Connections are heavy, every real nigga they fuck with you
Nails chipped out in diamonds, you sparkle but fuck man
The spark ain't enough for you
Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear that I get it, I get it, I get it
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We so far from finished, I brought you right back just so we can relive it
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
Your hustle don't ever go unnoticed baby, I'm with you I'm with it
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
Tonight was your night, go get you some lobsters and shrimp
You smart and you know it, I get it I get it, you outdo these pimps
I hope you don't fall, that's you on the top of the ceiling
Don't you ever forget 'bout your story, I get it, you did it you did it
Got a link on the champagne, your best friend is bar-tending
Your parents saying this another phase in your life
They can't wait until it's all finished
Shine on them hoes, let 'em know that you run shit
I get it I get it, I'm working too hard let's get into some fun shit
281 to my city, heard you had trouble at customs
Your girl got a DUI, I'll make the calls to get y'all through customs
Tell your best friend, "Girl get your paperwork right"
I get it I get it, what's up for the night?
Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear that I get it, I get it, I get it
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We so far from finished, I brought you right back just so we can relive it
Get it, get it, get it, drop down, drop drop down
Get it, get it, get it, drop down, drop drop down
Your momma used to live at the church on Sunday
You just go to LIV after church on Sunday
Oh Lord, oh Lord we're not in Kansas anymore
We're not in Kansas anymore
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and they end  up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, "Oh, well, this is life, I guess," Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Ohhh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, ohhh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, ohhh,ohhh
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'
I hope that God decides to talk through him
That the people decide to walk with him
Regardless of Pitchfork, cosigns I've jumped
Make sure the soundman doesn't cockblock the drums
Let the snare knock the air right out of your lungs
And those words be the oxygen
Just breathe
Amen, regardless I'mma say it
Felt like I got signed the day that I got an agent
Got an i
Tunes check, shit man I'm paying rent
About damn time that I got out of my basement
About damn time I got around the country and I hit these stages
I was made to slay them
Ten thousand hours
I'm so damn close I can taste it
On some Malcolm Gladwell
David-Bowie-meets-Kanye shit
This is dedication
A life lived for art is never a life wasted
Ten thousand
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me
Now, now, now
This is my world, this is my arena
The TV told me something different I didn't believe it
I stand here in front of you today all because of an idea
I could be who I wanted if I could see my potential
And I know that one day I'mma be him
Put the gloves on, sparring with my ego
Everyone's greatest obstacle, I beat him, celebrate that achievement
Got some attachments, some baggage I'm actually working on leaving
See, I observed Escher
I love Basquiat
I watched Keith Haring
You see I studied art
The greats weren't great because at birth they could paint
The greats were great cause they paint a lot
I will not be a statistic, just let me be
No Child Left Behind, that's the American scheme
I make my living off of words
And do what I love for work
And got around 980 on my SATs
Take that system
What did you expect
Generation of kids choosing love over a desk
Put those hours in and look at what you get
Nothing that you can hold, but everything that it is
Ten thousand
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me
Same shit, different day, same struggle
Slow motion as time slips through my knuckles
Nothing beautiful about it
No light at the tunnel
For the people that put the passion before them being comfortable
Raw, unmedicated heart, no substitute
Banging on table tops, no subs to toot
I'm feeling better than ever man
What is up with you
Scraping my knuckles, I'm battling with some drug abuse
I lost another friend, got another call from a sister
And I speak for the people that share that struggle too
Like they got something bruised
My only rehabilitation was the sweat
Tears and blood when up in the booth
It's the part of the show where it all fades away
When the lights go to black and the band leaves the stage
And you wanted a encore but there's no encore today
Cause the moment is now, can't get it back from the grave
Part of the show
It all fades away
Lights go to black
Band leaves the stage
You wanted an encore but there's no encore today
Cause the moment is now
Can't get it back from the grave
Welcome to the Heist
Welcome to the Heist
Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking a new hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope nope, y'all can't copy
Yup, Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushin'
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give it to the people, spread it across the country
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Tell me go up, gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said…
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up
Oh, oh, oh, oh…
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey-ee ay-ee ay-ee ay ay-ee ay-ee, hey
And all my people say
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey-ee ay-ee ay-ee ay ay-ee ay-ee, hey
And all my people say
Na na na na, na na na na
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And all my people say
Na na na na, na na na na
Mack-le-eh-eh-eh-eh-more!
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Let the night come, before the fight's won
Some might run against the test
But those that triumph embrace the fight 'cause
The fear is there to prove that courage exists
Now let the night come, before the fight's won
And some might run against the test
But those that triumph embrace the fight 'cause
The fear is there to prove that courage exists
"Hey, Macklemore, can we go thrift shopping?"
What what, what, what 
Bada, bada, bada dada
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting
Looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome
Now, walk into the club, like, "What up, I got a big cock!"
Nah, I’m just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, “Damn, that’s a cold ass honkey!”
Rolling in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink; except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
 But shit, it was 99 cents!
Fuck it, coppin' it, washin' it
‘Bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins
Someone else has been walking in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it, man
I am stunting and flossing and saving my money
And I’m hella happy; that’s a bargain, bitch!
I’ma take your grandpa's style, I’ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? 
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain’t got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, “Ah, he got the Velcros.”
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting
Looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome
What you know about rocking a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowing about wearing a fur fox skin?
I’m digging, I’m digging
I’m searching right through that luggage
One man’s trash, that’s another man’s come up
Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button-
Up shirt, ‘cause right now, I’m up in here stuntin'
I’m at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
I’m not, I’m not stuck on searchin' in that section 
Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
I’ll take those flannel zebra jammies
Second hand and I’ll rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, “Oh, that Gucci? That’s hella tight”
I’m like, “Yo, that’s 50 dollars for a t-shirt.”
Limited edition, let’s do some simple addition
50 dollars for a t-shirt, that’s just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting swindled and pimped, shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt’s hella dough, and having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don’t
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryin' to get girls from a brand?
Man, you hella won’t! Man, you hella won't!
Goodwill, poppin' tags, yeah!
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting
Looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome
I wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I’m in this big ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting
Looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome
"Is that your grandma's coat?"
And on, on and on, and on we go
And on, on and on, and on we go
We love what we had, but now it’s gone
Let’s leave before we eat each other alive
Alive
Same city, yeah, we can’t break up
Nice mask on, I wore the same one
The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled
Was convincing women that they looked
Better in their makeup
I wear war paint, fight to the casket
Too tired to apologize on this mattress
Emotional detachment – what’s the matter?
She’s learning that she never should have dated a rapper
I don’t blame her, my mind is gone
I’m at dinner, checking phone calls, texts and blogs
I don’t hear a word, I know nothing at all
Just concerned about the world
Memorizing these songs
Goes on and on
Don’t wanna break you, but I’m leading you on
On, on, on, on
And now it’s gone
And on, on and on, and on we go
And on, on and on, and on we go
We love what we had, but now it’s gone
Let’s leave before we eat each other alive
Alive
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You were the love of my life
This time we know we know
It’s over, over
Didn’t believe in love until we fell out
Gave the keys back, now I’m on the homie’s couch
Always going out, sleeping ‘round with strangers
Danger! But you can’t live without her
Now you’re paranoid, checking on her cellphone
Making sure she ain’t like you alone
Haven’t made love with the lights still on
It’s like you’re hiding something from me
Let’s fake another toast to the good life
Predict the future, clean slate, blue sky
Fantasy of me husband and you wife
Lyin’, staring into those two eyes
And I can’t take it, back to where we came from
My pavement, past the emotional earthquake foundation
Yeah, let’s keep swimming in the snake pit
Get bit, get out then jump back into the suffocation
Make up and fuck to save us like we got this
Come on, this is just us baby
And this is just a fight, this is just love – maybe
Is it just you or am I fucking crazy?
I swear to God, I wish that I could Photoshop the scars off
Cold world and gettin' my heart thawed
And I said it all and never get lock jaw
Mouth is a sawed off shotgun at any second could pop off
How does the truth taste?
My job comes with a complimentary toothpaste
Lately, I’ve been living up out of my suitcase
Building trust in that I’m leaving on Tuesday
Bought a one night stand, just a bootleg
A duplication of something authentic
Heart augmented, and it’s so hard to end it
I said peace before but this time I meant it
Can’t get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less
Can’t get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less
And on on and on and on we go
And on on and on and on we go
Love what we had but now it's gone
Let's leave before we eat each other alive
Alive
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You were the love of my life
This time we know we know
It's over
When I was in the third grade I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, "Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!"
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math
Like, "Yeah, I'm good at little league"
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw, nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And "God loves all his children" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the You
Tube comments lately?
"Man, that's gay" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
"Gay" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was in church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
We press play, don't press pause; progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is patient 
Love is kind 
Love is patient 
Love is kind 
Love is patient 
Love is kind 
Now, this is my job, I will not quit it
Pulled me out the depths when I thought that I was finished
Yeah I questioned if I could go the distance
That's just the work, regardless of who's listening, listening
Listen, see I was meant to be a warrior
Fight something amongst me, leave here victorious
Classroom of kids, or a venue performing
If I'd done it for the money I'd have been a fucking lawyer
Concrete, vagabond, van telling stories
Humbled by the road, I'm realizing I'm not important
See life's a beautiful struggle, I record it
Hope it helps you maneuvering through yours and
That's why we stay in the lab at night
I've been staring into this pad for over half my life
A true artist won't be satisfied
So I guess that's the sacrifice
And I say
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true, I say
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true
Forget about the fame, fortune and the mansion
Sitting and tripping watching myself on a plasma
Yeah, I start slipping when I'm thinking about that stuff
Ego once swollen until karma catches that up, that up
I'm my grandma's number one grandson
I lost myself to remember who that was
We start thinking about some kicks, necklace
What I really need is a job off Craigs
List
Take away the dot com, name, love
Fans, Twitter followers, and the buzz
See, you keep the issues but you take away the drugs
And I had to find out who I really was
Who I really wasn't
So sick of who I was becoming
Yeah, tired of running
Time to look at the man in the mirror until I can learn to love him
Of course I want dubs and a candy-painted 'lac
Watch the videos and get the girls in the back
But if that's what I believe in, and the reason that I rap
Uncle Sam is my pimp when he puts me on the track
Forget about the fame
I said forget about the fame
I'll forever remain faithful
Stay true, stay true, stay true
Uh-huh, um, 1-2
Now 'round here they sing broken hymns
Their prayers flow better when they're soaked in gin
The amp's dusty and sits in the corner
By a bartender that’ll pickpocket your heart
And a jukebox that’ll steal your quarter
Bartender, please give me a confession
Exchange fear for courage in the form of a well drink
There’s a heavy current, got a long way to swim
Closed the Bible a while ago, I need some shots for this sin
Hail Mary, come with me, feel like Pac when it hits
Got some fire in my belly and a riot in the gut
Bushmills for a band-aid, the sweet taste of blood
Then I might actually feel something if I don’t cover it up
Rusted faces, familiar places
Even if they haven’t left the vinyl booth that they stayed in
The motel next door, a sign that reads vacant
And a truth that’s so strong I’d be a fool not to chase it
But yea, I’m a fool and I stay here
Hope these problems drown themselves, I die in wait here
One more, four more, fuck it, a night cap
Service starts at 5 tomorrow and I’ll be right back
Underneath this fragile frame
Lives a battle between pride and shame
But I’ve misplaced that sense of pride
This crown of thorns is perched atop my spine
But listen closely as I testify
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night
I read the Bible but I forgot the verses
The liquor store is open later than the church is
Pure by their imperfections, everything is burning
To hell with the confessions, all the Lord Have Mercys
Blessed in holy water, the sin, oh Holy Father
Have you ever smelled flesh that sweats out Monarch vodka?
11 AM in the morning and you can’t get it off ya
Calling to the preacher but it’s like the pastor isn’t talking
Until the store opens and I can re-up on that doctrine
The people close to me say that I’m in need of a doctor
Think that I got a problem but these are not apostles
This is the drink of the Lord, that’s according to my gospel
Open to interpretation, if you’re judging it I don’t want it
I got sins that scald like my throat when I hit the bottle
And I’m sinking and that’s why I keep on drinking
I need a refill, far more than once every weekend
Sweet Jesus, I’m getting amnesia
Shaking til I’d get a taste, my faith is having seizures
Every time I walk away and try to leave it
Every time I walk away and try to leave it
Wouldn’t miss it for the world
Baptized in my vices and the bar is my church
Traded my artist and I pawned off the easel
Spend it all searching for God at the Neon Cathedral
Wouldn’t miss it for the world
Baptized in my vices and the bar is my church
Traded my artist and I pawned off the easel
Spend it all searching for God, Neon Cathedral
Neon Cathedral
Underneath this fragile frame
Lives a battle between pride and shame
But I’ve misplaced that sense of pride
This crown of thorns perched atop my spine
But listen closely as I testify
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at nightUh uh
Uh uh
I wanna be free
I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac
That is my shit
Now throw it up 
That’s what it is 
In my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C, bitch 
Can’t see me through my tints 
I’m riding real slow 
In my paint, wet, dripping, shining like my 24s 
I ain’t got 24s 
But I’m on those Vogues
That’s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, damn y’all mad
30K on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright
Man I’m lounging in some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking, bucking them out here
I’m looking fucking fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, there’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, there's a problem with this geezer
Got the keys in as I was leaving I started screaming
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snorting coke
She doing line after line like she’s writing rhymes
I had her inhaling my love, tryna blow my mind
Cadillac pimpin’, my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Driving and smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
Tires with the spokes on it and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keeping the buns all on
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fucking like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all, kill the fucking whips
See what's popping at the mall, meet a bad bitch
Slap her booty with my balls
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I’m motherfuckin’ awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga, fuck the limit
Got a window tinted for showing gangstas in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright
I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
Cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, I need all that shit
If I just went in and stole it, the police would have noticed
Gotta be strategic, creep it, go in, leave without motive
Hold up, my plan is forming, alright, casing this building
Watch these rappers that rappin' walk in and leave out with millions 
Headed in sweating, open that front door
"Interscope" printed out right by the entrance
Door closes, not a metaphor
Then I start towards that front desk, right where you check in
Dressed in a uniform, acting like a janitor
All blue, jumpsuit, rush in
Bloodthirsty for the money like a bull
Looking in the eyes of the matador 
Carrying two cans of paint, security looks at me awkward
I say third floor I'm late, paintin' Jimmy Iovine's office
Holding my breath 'bout to faint
I’m scared to death that he stops me
Heart beating so loud that you can hear the echo in that lobby
And see I'm breaking down if I don’t make it out
Then I'm leaving town with that contract
And I'm spazzing out, grabbing the A&R out
His chair and I'm taking him hostage
I don't give a fuck, step into the elevator, press "3"
Now I'm headed up 
What they don't know is there is a gun in the paint can
And I’m ready and willing to bust 'em, I'm fucking desperate
Stuck in this recession, now what you think
If I could get signed my life is destined
My future depends on ink
And secretary at the front of the entrance staring right at me
I walk up she whispers go ahead, and then gives me a wink
I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
Cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it
I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, I need all that shit
I made it past security, the secretary, the cubicles
But it’s weird, it’s like this room I’ve walked into is unusual
Thought it would be shiny and beautiful
Thought it would be alive and like musical
But it feels like someone died, it’s got the vibe of a funeral
There’s numbers on a chalkboard
CDs boxed in cardboard
Artists that flopped, that got dropped and never got to be sophomores
Graphic designers are sitting around
Waiting for albums that never come out
Complainin' that they have nobody in house
Wonderin’ what they make art for
I start thinking, am I in the right place?
Just walk forward, see plaques on the wall
Oh yeah, in a second those will be all yours
Finally see an office with a mounted sign, heaven-sent
Big, block, silver letters, read it out loud, "President" 
This was my chance to grab that contract and turn and jet
Right then felt a cold hand grab on the back of my neck
He said, "We’ve been watching you, so glad you could make it
Your music, it's so impressive, and this whole brand you created
You're one hell of a band, we here think you're destined for greatness
And with that right song we all know that you're next to be famous
Now I’m sorry, I’ve had a long day, remind me now what your name is?
That’s right, 'Macklemore,' of course... today has been crazy
Anyway, you ready? We’ll give you a hundred thousand dollars
After your album comes out, we’ll need back that money that you borrowed"
"So it’s really like a loan?"
"A loan?! Come on, no
We're a team, 360 degrees, we will reach your goals!
You'll get a third of the merch that you sell out on the road
Along with a third of the money you make when you’re out doing your shows
Manager gets twenty, booking agent gets ten
So shit, after taxes, you and Ryan have 7% to split!
That’s not bad, I’ve seen a lot worse
No one will give you a better offer than us"
"Mm-hm," I replied, "I appreciate the offer"
Thought that this is what I wanted
Rather be a starving artist
Than succeed at getting fucked
I was seven years old
When I got my first pair
And I stepped outside
And I was like, "Momma
This air bubble right here
It’s gonna make me fly"
I hit that court
And when I jumped, I jumped
I swear I got so high
I touched the net, "Mom, I touched the net!
This is the best day of my life"
Air Maxes were next
That air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffing, the tread
In school
I was so cool
I knew that I couldn’t crease em
My friends couldn’t afford em
Four stripes on their Adidas
On the court I wasn’t the best
But my kicks were like the pros
Yo, I stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, book bag was so dope
And then my friend Carlos’ brother got murdered for his fours
Whoa
See he just wanted a jump shot
But they wanted his Starter coat, though
Didn’t wanna get caught
From Genesee Park to Othello
You'd get clowned for those Pro Wings, with the velcro
Those were not tight
I was trying to fly without leaving the ground
Cause I wanted to be like Mike, right
Wanted to be him
I wanted to be that guy
I wanted to touch the rim
I wanted to be cool
And I wanted to fit in
I wanted what he had, America, it begins
I want to fly
Can you take me far away
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I’ll go so high
I’ll go so high
My feet won’t touch the ground
Just stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down
We want what we can’t have
Commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn
I just got to flaunt it
Got to show em
So exclusive, this that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes
I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me
I’m a cool kid
I’m an individual, yeah
But I’m part of a movement
My movement told me be a consumer and I consumed it
They told me to just do it
I listened to what that swoosh said
Look at what that swoosh did
See it consumed my thoughts
"Are you stupid?
Don’t crease 'em! Just leave 'em in that box!"
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That’s my air bubble and I’m lost, if it pops
We are what we wear
We wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all
Will I stand for change
Or stay in my box
These Nikes help me define me
But I’m trying to take mine
Off
I want to fly
Can you take me far away
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I’ll go so high
I’ll go so high
My feet won’t touch the ground
Just stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down
They started out
With what I wear to school
That first day
Like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am
What I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change
Consumption is in the veins
And now I see it’s just another pair of shoes
I need love
You need love
Give me love
And I'll give you my love
They say thirty's the new twenty
And twenty's the new thirty, shit I guess
Makes sense, 'cause fifteen-year-olds seem twenty
And twenty-five -year-olds seem ten
I used to drink away my paycheck
Celebrate the mistakes I hadn't made yet
Our generation isn't the best on safe sex
We forget the latex, becoming Planned Parenthood patients
Synthetic heroin is the new basehead
So much to escape, fuck a straight edge
Walk around looking through a fake lens
Apps this good, who's got time to make friends?
I wish I didn't care
If cynical hispters with long hair
And cocaine problems, like my music
It's not my issue, I can't solve it
My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
Eyes open, awake for the very first time
We both forfeit this game of crime
They say, "It's so refreshing to hear somebody on records
No guns, no drugs, no sex, just truth"
The guns - that's America, the drugs are what they gave to us
And sex sells itself, don't judge 'til it's you
Ah, I'm not more or less conscious
Than rappers rapping 'bout them strippers up on a pole, popping
These interviews are obnoxious
Saying that "It’s poetry, you’re so well spoken," stop it
I grew up during Reaganomics
When Ice T was out there on his killing cops shit
Or Rodney King was getting beat on
And they let off every single officer
And Los Angeles went and lost it
Now every month there's a new Rodney on You
Tube
It's just something our generation is used to
And neighbourhoods where you never see a news crew
Unless they're gentrifying, white people don't even cruise through
And my subconscious telling me stop it
This is an issue that you shouldn't get involved in
Don't even tweet "R.I.P Trayvon Martin"
Don't wanna be that white dude million-man marching
Fighting for a freedom that my people stole
Don't wanna make all my white fans uncomfortable
"But you don't even have a fuckin' song for radio
Why you out here talking race, trying to save the fucking globe?"
Don't get involved if the cause isn't mine
White privilege, white guilt, at the same damn time
So we just party like it's 1999
Celebrate the ignorance while these kids keep dying
My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
Eyes open, awake for the very first time
We both forfeit this game of crime
I need love
You need love
Give me love
And I'll give you my love
Everything is gold, everything is equal
Posted on the porch just chillin', me and my people
Eyelids closed, gold sun shines on
The world’s coated in the gold Krylon
Yea, and these days days days
They never run away
Gold tints, shades, that block out that golden haze
Take all the gold from the pawnshop that lives behind the case
And g-g-give it away
When gold erupted from volcanoes in the heavens
And every shrine that existed in time melting
Tombs open, Dookie Ropes on the bells
When everything is gold, who cares about the carats?
They say that gold's the skin of the gods
You can’t take the band there when you’re gone
I’ll tip over that kiosk in the mall
As the sunset falls into tomorrow
Today we're feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toe
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold
Five hundred thousand sold
Slick rick gold, rope's on, hella cold
Yea we’re feeling like gold
So fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold
Alright now we open up that car door
Hop out, hope they notice us
Throughout society we been locked in that cobra clutch
More gold bottles, gold bottles, never sober up
Ditch Jesus, In Gold I Trust
I solemnly swear to wear my cross and stunt
Separate myself by sticking out just because
That’s how you illustrate power and who you’re above
But nah, tonight we take it, take it, giving it back
Crack open the vault, let everyone mob in the bank
Take whatever they want, we party and give thanks
I've been rocking gold chains since P was in the tank
You only live once, you only live once
Watch Rick Ross give his Jesus piece to a bum
Cause tonight we ball, we ball, we comin’ up
Paintin' the globe gold, two steppin’ on the sun
Today we're feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toe
Gold coins, gold phone, gold car
Costs at least 10 racks to get 16 gold bars
Gold rush, suck on my gold dust stuntin
Under these gold trunks, that’s 2 golden nugget
Flyin' on the gold eagle, flier than the rest of ‘em
Past the Space Needle, golden shower on pedestrians
"Excuse me, that’s my bad, that’s my eagle and he shouldn’t have"
My ego got hair, that motherfucker got a mullet bruh
And it’s gold, two girls gold brass
Lounging on the water, feet in the gold sand
Sipping on Orangina, arms around them both pants
They’re sipping Olde English right out of a gold can
Two girls, gold spandex so pretty
That girl ain’t even gold, she just got golden girl titties
I’m kidding, everyone is gold in my city
You paint Betty White gold, even Betty White can get it
Get it get it get it..
Today we're feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toe
Oh oh oh oh oh
So we’re feeling like gold
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
1,2, now
Those three-plus years, I was so proud of
Then I threw them all away for two Styrofoam cups
The irony, everyone will think that "He lied to me"
Made my sobriety so public, there's no fucking privacy
If I don't talk about it then I carry a date
A "08/10/08" that now has been changed
And everyone that put me in some box as a saint
That I never was, just a false prophet that never came
And will they think that everything that I've written has all been fake?
Or will I just take my slip to the grave?
What the fuck are my parents gonna say?
The success story that got his life together and changed
And you know, what pain looks like
When you tell your dad you relapsed and look at him directly into his face
Deceit on your shoulders, deceivingly heavy weight
Haven't seen tears like this on my girl in a while
The trust that I once built has been betrayed
But I'd rather live telling the truth and be judged for my mistakes
Than falsely held up, given props, loved and praised
I guess, I gotta get this on the page
Feeling sick and helpless
Lost the compass where self is
I know what I've gotta do, and I can't help it
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I've gotta find a way to tell them
God help 'em, yeah
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I've gotta find a way to tell them
We fall, so hard, now we gotta get back what we lost, lost
I thought you’d gone, but you were with me all along, along
And every kid that came up to me
And said I was the music they listened to when they first got clean
Now look at me, a couple days sober, I'm fighting demons
Back of that meeting on the East Side, shaking, tweaking
Hope that they don't see it, hope that no one is looking
That no one recognizes that failure under that hoodie
Just posted in the back with my hands crossed, shooken
If they call on me I'm passin', if they talk to me I'm booking
Out that door, but before, I can make it
Somebody stops me and says "Are you Macklemore?
Maybe this isn't the place or time, I just wanted to say that
If it wasn't for 'Otherside,' I wouldn't have made it"
I just looked down at the ground and say, "Thank you"
She tells me she has nine months, and that she's so grateful
Tears in her eyes, looking like she's gonna cry, fuck
I barely got forty-eight hours, treated like I'm some wise monk
I want to tell her I relapsed, but I can't
I just shake her hand and tell her, "Congrats"
Get back to my car, and I think I'm tripping, yeah
Cause God wrote "Otherside," that pen was in my hand
I'm just a flawed man, man, I fucked up
Like so many others, I just never thought I would
I never thought I would, didn't pick up the book
Doin' it by myself didn't turn out that good
If I can be an example of getting sober
Then I can be an example of starting over
If I can be an example of getting sober
Then I can be an example of starting over
We fall, so hard, now we gotta get back what we lost, lost
I thought you’d gone, but you were with me all along, along
And we drink and get older
And some of us even try to get sober
Now here's to the assholes and the last calls
We're city kids
You get what you ask for
And acquaintances turn to friends
I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those years as the centrepiece
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR
Hold on to what you were, forget what you're not
The streets were ours that summer
At least those two blocks
Reminisce on those days
I guess that's OK, you wonder why
Some grow up, move on
Close the chapter
Live separate lives
The twenty-something confusion before the suit and tie
Strangers become mistakes
But those mistakes made you feel alive
Hindsight is vibrant, reality
Rarely lit
Memories, a collage pasted with glue that barely sticks
Good Lord, they broke all my shields
Locked bathroom doors
Graffiti and high heels
Until you felt that altitude you don't know how high feels
Party mountain
Some don't ever come down from around here
To be young again
I guess it's relative
The Camel Lights
The whiskey, ryes
Sink into the skin
I fantasize about a second wind
Grow a moustache
Pick up another bad habit and let the games begin
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR
So here's to the nights
Dancing with the band
Strangers into girlfriends from a one night stand
Poor out a little liquor and turn up the Johnny Cash
You could bring a receipt to Heaven but you cannot take it back
And this is life, this is real
Even when it feels like it isn't
I'd be a goddamn liar to say at times I didn't miss it
So deuces, I turn my back as I walk into the distance
Dip my feet in every once in a while
Just to say I visit
And we hold onto these nights
Trying to find our way home by the street light
Over time we figure out this is me, right
Learn a lot about your friends right around two A.M
And acquaintances turn to friends
I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those years as the centrepiece
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Will you come party with me in my
Castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle?
This is for the freaks and for my magicians
Booty clap and lap dancing technicians
Dance parties in the name of Great Britain
And American girls who love the Detroit Pistons
Like Dennis Rodman, I got a rod man 
Long wong-dong in a soft hand
And a pink palm pink schlong, let's all dance!
From England to Stockholm
I'm wearing a cape just like a poncho
I got a cutey and I'm making a beat on her booty
Like I was at Bonnaroo beating up on a bongo
I got a bottle of Martinelli's and I'm dumping
All over anybody that's kicking it in the grotto
Neighbors keep tripping, I'm like, "I'm in a castle
Fuck your condo!"
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
You like to party, I am a party-er
You like to wander, I am a wanderer
Your thighs are the closet to Narnia
Is it cool if I go and get lost in that?
I'm the lion, the witch in the wardrobe
Massage my lap, I have a sore bone
Of course cold on the dance floor
Like an Eskimo's toes in the North Pole
With both toes poking out of two holes
In the Eskimo socks, I'm hot
Like a cauldron from a warlock
Wearing sweatpants in a sauna
Who's your father? I'm not
I'm motherfuckin' Raven Bowie and here's my cock
Rooster, cock-a-doodle-doo sir
Take a hit of the hookah, now make it drop
Girl's booty was bigger than the stomach of Rick Ross'
Holy mother mountain of tender tendon to get lost in
Bounce, bounce, that castle booty, that bottom
Make it wobble, wobbly-wobble 'till my third leg has to hobble
You don't want to look back on this night
And think I should have been freaking on a booty
Freak-freaking on a booty
This might be the best night that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had together
Eh, motherfuckin' eh
Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of a party
In the night, in the middle of a party
Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of the night
In the middle of a party
Brought it home and threw it on the carpet
Someone kill a coyote, I'm starving
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Grab your bagpipe, I grab my flute
Cause drunk King John is still in the loo
Get onto the pole in a birthday suit, our suit
And M.J. was King, and Prince was Prince
And Raven has ruled ever since
I used to sit with my dad in the garage
That sawdust, that Pinesol, and the moss
Around every spring, when the winter thawed
We’d huddle around the radio, twist the broken knob
710 AM, no KJR. Dave Niehaus' voice would echo throughout the yard
Couldn’t have been older than 10
But to me and my friends
The voice on the other end might as well have been God’s
1995, the Division Series
Edgar's up to bat
Bottom of the 11th inning
Got the whole town listening
"Swung on and belted," the words distorted. "Joey Cora rounds third!
Here comes Griffey! The throw to the plate’s not in time!
My, oh my, the Mariners win it!"
Yes. Fireworks, they lit up that ceiling in the Kingdome
We had just made history
"Swung on and lined down the left field line for a base hit! Here comes Joey! Here comes Junior to third base! They’re gonna wave him in! The throw to the plate will be… late! The Mariners are going to play for the American League Championship! I don’t believe it! It just continues! My, oh my!"
Laces woven, barely holdin’ that stitch
The creases of time amongst the grime and the grit
Where the leather he used to pound his fists
To some it's just a mitt, but see that glove was him
Yep, tell me stories on the field, with that sun-stained brim
Blood under my chin, he taught me how to spit
Sunflower seeds back with me and my crew
Sunburnt arms
Big League Chew
Yeah we were like, The Sandlot after dinner
After practice we'd listen
To the M’s in the kitchen
And if mom wasn’t trippin’
"Come on dad! Please, I swear, just one more inning!"
Voice went "pump, pump!" through the system
"Break out the rye bread! It's grand salami time!"
"My, oh my! Another victory!"
Yes. My city, my city
Childhood, my life watchin’ Griffey right under those lights
Under that light rain, gleaming in that night game, can't stop now
Keep moving, no brake pads!
Came here to prove a point, live my life on the field
Make history in between the base paths
And compete against the fear that is in me that’s my only barrier and I swear that I'mma break that!
From the mud
The cleats that we drug
Through the feet
This is that moment, and you can't take it back
I don’t really collect cards anymore, just a box and some old cardboard
Memories embedded in the dust, in the fibres that age just like us
Livin’ somewhere off in the drawer
This is what you make of it. Yeah, we play to win
Live it like we’re under the lights of the stadium
Fight until the day that God decides to wave us in
Right, until he waves us in
It’s my city, my city, childhood, my life. That’s right
Under those lights
My city, my city, childhood, that’s right. Niehaus, "My, oh my!"
Come on. My city, my city, childhood, my life. That’s right, under those lights
It's my city, my city, childhood, my life, Niehaus. My, oh my. Rest in peace
Now they say, "Don't forget where you come from
Don't die holding on to your words
Cause you know, that you got a whole world to change
But understand who you gotta change first"
And I was like "Fuck that", humility bust back
I remember the days with nothing but a bus pass
I was just a little shorty, just hopin' that I could find a bum
To buy a 40 for me and have enough for a bud sack
Yeah, and I dance on that instrumental
Unorthodox like Basquiat with the pencil
Give me a microphone and a beat box I could vent to
Music the only medium that I could find myself through
Recluse, sippin' on some lean I would let loose
Lookin' in the mirror, watchin' myself lose
Cleaned up in oh-eight, got a job makin' barely minimum wage
To get into that page
Hit the road with R.L., performing in front of eight people
And that shit will check your ego
About around that time I'm watching that EP go
From nothing to getting us booked around the country
I know no limits, life can change in an instant
Eight people turn into sold out shows in a minute
Now watching my pops in the back row grinnin'
With his glass up to my mom, toastin' his Guinness
And we on, we on
Good music, it lies in the ambiance
One day we'll leave here
But these words live on
Till then, we keep on making the songs
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
Put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
I remember that Freshman edition
Last year thinking to myself like
Yeah, nah, I won't win it yet, I probably won't get it, but
I'ma give it everything, play my position
The next 11 months I gave it all, everything I had in me
Left blood, sweat, tears in every god damn city
No label, no deal, no publicist, indie
Just music that connected and fans that rode with me
Throw me a gold mine, and a co-sign
While you're riding a couple dope rides
Two women, both dimes
Not gonna lie, that shit sounds so nice
But I got creative control, and my soul's mine
I wouldn't trade it, maybe I'm crazy
I put on for my city, Seattle, that raised me
Rule four-thousand-and-eighty, it's really not changing
Now a days make good music, the people are your label
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
Put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
Oh my God
Feels like a victory lap
Can I have that moment
Can I talk my shit
Now they say, "Don't forget where you come from
Don't die holding on to your words
Cause you know, that you got a whole world to change
But understand who you gotta change first"
Put 'em, up, up, up up
Up, up, up up
Put 'em, up, up, up up
Macklemore, Ryan Lewis
Put 'em up, up, up up
Up, up, up up
Put 'em, up, up, up up 
I ain't gonna die tonight
You can't kill me, not my spirit 
History is ours tonight
The people are chantin', can't you hear it?
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Open up the doors on 'em, we playin' tonight
Bring on the marchin' band and turn on the stadium lights
They gon' learn from me, this is our church of The
Life of a champion, ugh, so Freddie Mercury
Sneakin' into Hov concerts in nosebleeds
The Hov bein' like "whoa"
Yeah, independent, keep killin' these people and don't sleep
Even the pigeon-toed still standin' on both feet, you know
It's obvious whose night this is
Grandparents immigrants, couple Irish kids
Victory in my grasp, gotta fight for this
The streets are ours this evening, goin' undefeated
I roll the dice against the staircase, uh huh
Steak season gotta marinate, uh huh
If I happen to die tonight, put my spirit in the stars
Bury me in the grave and carve "The history was ours"
Said I—
I ain't gonna die tonight
You can't kill me, not my spirit 
History is ours tonight
The people are chantin', can't you hear it?
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Wake up, bitch, I ain't dead yet
And if I was in heaven, I'd be the best dressed
My closet lookin' like a swap meet in Texas
And maybe it's excess, but
We ain't cut from the same cloth, player
Talkin' to a boss player
Checks like a ball player
Easy money, all layups
I be pissin' off neighbors
Get up off my dick and get the finger like a cross-fader
I be in my lawn chair, star gazin' like, woo!
All praise to the most high
Your boy in his own J's, I made it to courtside
Remember the old days and playin' for co-signs
When labels offer me pay, I said that I won't sign
I took my weakness and turned that into a weapon
And when everybody doubted me, I turned that to my leverage
So I stand up on the stage, it wasn't planned, see it was destined
Look at fifty-thousand people with their hands into the heavens
Said I—
I ain't gonna die tonight
You can't kill me, not my spirit 
History is ours tonight
The people are chantin', can't you hear it?
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Didn't come this far to lose
Won't let death make a move
Might not mean much to you, but I'd die for this W
Let my life be something to prove
Every scrape, every fight, every cut, every bruise
I'll lay it all on the line, I'll re-write these rules
Victory in my sight, I will not lose
I ain't gonna die tonight
You can't kill me, not my spirit 
History is ours tonight
The people are chantin', can't you hear it?
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
You know I'm back like I never left
Another sprint, another step
Another day, another breath
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept
I got a new attitude and a lease on life
And some peace of mind
Seek and I find I can sleep when I die
Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight
I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people or did I do it all for fame?
Legend it's exodus searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo!
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious
I'm feeling glorious
The crib looking Victorian 
You know that we been going in
Since we hopped out that Delorean 
En garde, things are just things
They don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smiling down on me like woo, that boy got bars
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, don't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag they don't understand
The world is up for grabs
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag they don't understand
The world is up for grabs
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious
Can’t nobody get up in my car today
Back seat feeling like a charter plane
Bumping Silkk Da Shocker Charge It 2 Da Game
Paint dripping like I’m whipping marmalade 
Look at the way that I’m shining
I don’t be checking the mileage
She said how much is that Rolie?
I said don’t worry I’m timeless
Watching Toy Story 3, that’s a great fucking movie
City of Jimi, Kurt, Quincy
City of me, Eddie, and Bruce Lee 
King of the road I drive slow like whoa
And I just switched over to Geico like whoa
Celebrating these life goals
But you ain’t getting no ride home
I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up, I need that bass
And my chain so bright can’t see my face
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town
All eyes on me now
I be riding through Seatown
Taking pics when I eat out
Girls ask me to freestyle
Neighbors hate it when I speed out
I ain’t turning these beats down
GPS and I reroute
Chuck the deuce and I peace out
Sun roof tinted, don't need your opinions
I be on my business, and you be on Tinder
And if I was single, I’d be right there with ya
But I’m committed, keep my dick in my britches
The women are moving their bodies
Sunset through numerous palm trees
Followed by the paparazzi
But they don’t get into our party
Tell the bell hop that I’m sorry
We 40 deep in the lobby
Travel the world with a posse
But soon I’ll be home
So call up my momma and tell her to pick up the phone
Cause I need that homemade lasagna that’s fresh out the stove
Grabbing the keys and I’m fresh out the door
King of my city whose next on the throne
I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up, I need that bass
And my chain so bright can’t see my face
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
When you hear that speaker sound, ound, ound
You know who it is, Lil Boat in your town
Whoa this beat so happy I will never frown
And my hair so nappy it’s gonna be a problem braiding it down
Oh no, oh no, we been grinding from the go
Jump start, I just bought a new whip, push start
Push the coup down the highway like a go kart
All my niggas keep that toaster with them like a Pop Tart
Make her moan and she sound just like Mozart
Pure art
I think they mad because I broke into the game with a crowbar
Top the charts, Hip Hop ain’t the same we the new stars
Rock stars, look at all my chains call them ice pops
Ring pops, let the rain drop on the wrist watch
Fuck the cops, and fuck Donald Trump, bitch it’s Macklemore and Lil Boat
Anything else you need to know
I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up, I need that bass
And my chain so bright can’t see my face
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town
R.I.P. Willy Wonka, watch the roof come off 
I pull up in that candy paint, call it Veruca Salt 
You cheated and you lied, you broke the rules, my dawg 
Now you wanna come around when there's food involved
Hell no
Let the truth be told, I'm in a Coogie robe
With the Dookie rope, and Lil Boosie on 
I'm eating sushi rolls, doin' the tootsie roll 
Thinkin' 'bout future goals, hater what you been on? 
I'm in a neutral zone, I'm 'bout to lose control
Then I'm hoppin' out, you think it's Rick Ross
I'm pullin' out in that Maybach
Didn't cop that from the thrift shop 
With my daughter, singing "Hakuna Matata"
Why they hootin' and hollerin'
I'm maneuverin' out to Budapest
And my baby momma duckin' the audit
The IRS been callin', tryna get in my wallet
But they ain't gettin' all of it
I put my feet up on the ottoman, I ought to be relaxin', y'all 
'Cause I'm just 'bout that action boss, 'b-b-bout that action boss
I'm a motherfuckin' icon 
Boots made of python 
I met with the Pres and I'm in Obama's i
Pod 
My front yard got all kinda cars
Long Caddy, blue body, call it Avatar
I don't really fuck with the caviar
6 figures gets you 16 Wonka bars, give me that
Willy Wonka flavor 
Willy Wonka been had haters 
Willy Wonka live on acres 
Willy Wonka got a lot of paper 
Golden ticket put you in a wraither 
I barely see my own neighbors 
Willy Wonka, I got flavor
Willy Wonka, I got flavor
Flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, lifesaver
Flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, lifesaver
Flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, lifesaver

I woke up like
Bitch, I'm Willy Wonka
Bitch, I'm Willy Wonka
Bitch, I'm Willy Wonka
Bitch, I'm Willy Wonka
I got more flavor than Willy Wonka 
I took three bitches to Benihana's 
I took a jet out to Punta Cana 
She got her lips 'round my my anaconda 
Hands on my hip when I grip the burner 
Roll up some cookie, you smell the burner 
Willy Wonka probably pour deuce
Blowin' up this money like a flute
I pipe the shit up but can't pipe that bitch up 
No, Super Bowl ring, but not one Super Bowl 
Ooh, what would you do for some dough? 
Flash, I took a picture for Vogue 
I never play with my nose 
My wrist is a 'fridgerator 'cause it's cold 
Pull up in the frog, I suppose 
I was broke when I was a tadpole 
Hoppin' out the ghost 
Jumpin' in the crowd off the ropes 
All in her mouth like Scope 
Green Lamborghini, four-clover 
How many horses up in your motor? 
Snakes in the grass, they cobras 
Tryna get five hundred like Hova 
Rain drop, iced out emoji
Willy Wonka flavor 
Willy Wonka been had haters 
Willy Wonka live on acres 
Willy Wonka got a lot of paper 
Golden ticket put you in a wraither 
I barely see my own neighbors

Gemini
I wanna be sober, but I love gettin' high
Wanna give it a hundred percent, but I'm too afraid to try
I wanna be faithful, but love hookin' up with randos
I wanna live by the law, but still think like a vandal
I wanna get exercise, but I'm too lazy to workout
I want all the finer things, but don't wanna go to work now
I wanna go outside, take my family to the beach
I wake up in the morning, first thing I do is look at a screen, at a screen
Wanna live freely, why isn't it so easy?
I should read a book, but I keep watchin' this TV
And I know this lifestyle doesn't really feed me
I just tune out to the voice inside that's speaking
All my little problems keep on buildin' up, and buildin' up
All my good intentions just ain't good enough, can't find the love
So I smoke until my lungs are full
And drink until I lose my cool
Apology's my middle name, and one day I will change, but
I'm okay with who I am today
I'm okay with who I, who I am today
I want world peace, but I wanna watch Worldstar
I know that I should stay home, and still wanna kick it where the girls are
I wanna be a feminist, but I'm still watchin' porno
I wanna eat healthy, but I'ma eat this Di
Giornos
We live on social media, read other people's thoughts
Tweet about justice, but don't show up to the march
I think about the earth, and I think about the eco
What am I willin' to sacrifice at the expense of my ego?
Wanna live freely, why isn't it so easy?
I should read a book, but I keep watchin' this TV
And I know this lifestyle doesn't really feed me
I just tune out to the voice inside that's speaking
All my little problems keep on buildin' up, and buildin' up
All my good intentions just ain't good enough, can't find the love
So I smoke until my lungs are full
And drink until I lose my cool
Apology's my middle name, and one day I will change, but
I'm okay with who I am today
I'm okay with who I, who I am today
I'm okay with who I am today
I'm okay with who I, who I am today
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days
I was thinkin' 'bout the band
I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loadin' merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin' up, still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days
Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
Those good old days
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days
Never thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young
Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missin' what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past
While missin' out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile
I've got some scars, I've been around
I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
Those good old days
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days
I said "woo", don't make me
Break out the velour suit and the Stacey's
Give me a baseline and a break beat
Fuck around on the dance floor, make a baby, watch me
Got a cane with a gold tip
Gucci ice cream tat type flow, bitch
I could make it rain, but I won't, shit
'Cause I'm cheap, motherfucker and I don't tip 
Watch out, I'm about to pull this new watch out, ta dow
Puttin' in work, we don't clock out
How 'bout, we go and cut the rug at the pow-wow
Get to movin' and breakin' and poppin' like wild style
Electric boogaloo
She movin' that body like a booty in a hula hoop
Gave her that look like, "You don't know what I'd do to you"
And she was like "Oh my God, I just Googled you"
Jheri curl, mullet on some Mario Lopez
Last call, then we go and hit the coat check
Lyft outside, buenos noches
Now tell that motherfucker, take us back to the homestead, gone
Now take your shoes off in here
We don't need to talk 
I said "I'm shooting for the moon, baby"
Now watch me walk 
I don't believe in gravity, honey
I'm an astronaut 
Just wanna see you levitate, and I'ma watch 
Whoa whoa whoa 
Yeah yeah yeah 
Hey now 
Alright now 
Gon' levitate 
Gon' levitate 
Oh shit, she just gave me her number 
You now dealing with the Irish hustler 
Like a 2002 Usher 
Let that burn, nah, I'm wearing a rubber
Plaid on me, dancin' like a one man army
Turn a funeral into a dance party
Meet the Holy Ghost, I'ma catch me a body
You don't wanna see me when I start doin' the zombie, Thriller
Master P, barbecue chip, Percy Miller
That's a rap snack, I'm a fat dad, got some fat abs
Sweatin' like I'm eatin' jalapeños out in Baghdad
You ain't on the level, got a medal for the flash dance
You ain't fucking gigging, what the hell you getting mad at?
I pulled up in that purple thang
I didn't dress like Prince in Purple Rain 
Lions, cheetahs like the circus came
And I should charge everybody to observe the game
Pour shots, big up and fuck cops
Invite the whole neighborhood to a party on my block
Up rock a booty, juicier than a cumquat
Boyfriend mean muggin', little buddy fuck off
Now take your shoes off in here
We don't need to talk 
I said "I'm shooting for the moon, baby"
Now watch me walk 
I don't believe in gravity, honey
I'm an astronaut 
Just wanna see you levitate, and I'ma watch 
Whoa whoa whoa 
Yeah yeah yeah 
Hey now 
Alright now 
Gon' levitate 
Gon' levitate 
Gon' get down, we gon' get down
Get down so you gotta get up
Don't sit down, don't sit down
Two steppin' 'til the sun come up, come on
We gon' get down, get down
Get down so you gotta get up
Don't sit down, don't sit down
Two steppin' til the sun come up, come on
Gon' get down, we gon' get down
Get down so you gotta get up
Don't sit down, don't sit down
Two steppin' til the sun come up, come on
We gon' get down, get down
Get down so you gotta get up
Don't sit down, don't sit down
Two steppin' til the sun come up, come on
Got a Guns N' Roses T-shirt, and never listened to the band
Just being honest, I just thought that shit looked cool
Hold up, do you know who I am?
Turn the block to Woodstock
Retire? Don't think that I could stop
Jet-ski the way I ride the beat
And fuck your wave, I'ma die knowing that I did me
I got some words and I cannot let them die in me
This is arena status
Our bones end up in the ground, does it even matter?
Make some good music, get what you put in
Get out and go and leave the planet
Now what the hell did you think this is?
We're born, we're dying, in-between we live
Love, prosper, hands to the sky, catch a gospel
Roll the dice, nah, I ain't betting on tomorrow
Chain looking like Orion's Belt
Jacket looking something like a lion pelt
Had to take a break and find myself
They put me in a box by myself
The same writers criticizing my rhymes
Are the same writers that gentrifyin' Bed-Stuy
I can't even see the hate, I should probably check my eyes
I got 50,000 phones pointed at me in the sky
Between a rock and a hard place
Cold blunted with a stone face
Firebreather, firebreather
Born under a blood moon
But the sun is coming up soon
Firebreather, firebreather
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Firebreather, firebreather
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Firebreather, yeah, firebreather
What the fuck you think I'm doing it for?
Hungry like it's my rookie year, and I'm new to the sport
The game is tied up, they looking at you in the fourth
Do you take the shot or pass it, this is ten-thousand hours
And I'm working on my Master's, liabilities, and assets
And I'm showing up to practice, shooting early, getting baskets
There's no father to my style, I'm just a freckle-faced bastard
An animal in the jungle, running, hunting with a habit 
Abracadabra that motherfucker is magic
It's '81 and Madonna is on me dancing
I'm sorry momma, I got it, I know I should mind my manners
I'd probably go double-platinum if I could think of an ad-lib
I'm jazz Prince, I rap a lot
I grew up on Scarface, now Brad's my dawg 
Irish goodbye, sayonara and we mobbin'
Put the nail in the coffin, motherfucker, I'm on one
Between a rock and a hard place
Cold blunted with a stone face
Firebreather, firebreather
Born under a blood moon
But the sun is coming up soon
Firebreather, firebreather
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Firebreather, firebreather
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Firebreather, yeah, firebreather
Don't nobody give a damn what all that shit talking 'bout, man, we tryna hear some of that, that "Girl, shake your ass, shake your ass, shake your ass," you know what I'm sayin'? I'm tryna get that in my life
Gemini
Diamond, diamond, diamond, that's my shit 
Oh, juice , three-piece, crisp 
Saucey, dripping , CEO of this 
Curry, wavy, my undertow's a bitch
Shoutout to my city, know I really does this
Third time's a charm, I'm feeling triumphant 
I put a little gold up on my bicuspids
They can only see my eyes inside of the Cutlass 
She may be vanilla cream, baby her butt big
They treat me like Mc
Gregor when I'm out in Dublin 
My momma don't like it when I be cussin' 
But fuck these motherfuckers, momma, I don't trust them 
It's plush up in the bucket, look, don't touch it, thought you knew
In the pocket, like I'm Russel, man I hustle, watch me move
In the summer watch me fuck around, I'm 'bout to drop the roof
She hopped up in the whip and then I taught her how to play the flute, play the flute
Goddamn, they hatin' on a player 
Don't understand, they need to get they weight up 
Shazam, I'ma have to David Blaine 'em 
Emoji hands, I'm praying for them haters 
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ay little mama, aqui
Skin tone macchiato, we eating mahi-mahi
On Miami Beach, we have a party la-dee-da-dee
On my B-I-E 'til I D-I-E, I think I'm king 
You didn't think that I would get the peacoat 
Unbutton that motherfucker, nothing but a speedo 
Who's that peeking in my window?, Cee-Lo
I was on that Khujo, that Big Gipp and that T-Mo 
Dolce and Gabbana, cappuccino, gelato
In a grotto out in Cabo, amateurs so apollo
Whip this bulky like Costco, I'm out here and dodging 5-0
I hit the block with that top low, a dookie rolled with a poncho
But it ain't about to rain on me
Tryna sing up in this bitch, but I ain't on key
Now I stay genuine, I'm the same old G
Feeling like John Havlicek, check, with these eight gold rings
Play the flute
Goddamn, they hatin' on a player 
Don't understand, they need to get they weight up 
Shazam, I'ma have to David Blaine 'em 
Emoji hands, I'm praying for them haters 
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
I paid my dues, now I'm really on
Prince to the SEA, put my city on
Left the condo for a bigger home
Everything clean like my chicken bones
I work hard, I work hard for it
Had to go back to the chalkboard
We was tourin' countries all foreign
Now I don't gotta open car doors
So say what's up to my haters at the club tonight
I'll be busy singing my daughter lullabies
When she sleep, I hit the booth and get super lit
Living my dreams I can sleep in another life
Living my dreams I can sleep in another life, yeah
The tensions so thick, you can cut with a butter knife, yeah
If that's your example of artists, then what am I?
You lied, they consume it, you say that you boomin'
That's probably why Metro don't trust you, gosh
I am not surprised, I am not surprised, yeah
Had to optimize, then monopolize, yeah
We turn out the lights, then we come alive, yeah
All these dollar signs, ain't no 9 to 5, yeah
I am not surprised, I am not surprised, yeah
Had to optimize, then monopolize, yeah
We turn out the lights, then we come alive, yeah
All these dollar signs, ain't no 9 to 5, yeah
Ten million sold, go and look at that
Ain't no middleman gonna get any of that
I suck at math, but I know how to add 
That's a whole lotta money
Bought my baby's momma momma a pad
Wow, do a spin move on stage looking like the white James Brown
There's a whole lotta people in this arena, you know it sold out 
Took my daughter on the road and she pointing at me from the crowd 
Saying, "That's my daddy, top 5 on stage," no doubt
In God we trust, God we trust
They ain't came in the same way
They are not with us, not with us
Came back and it's game time
This the follow-up, and now I'm up
I decided that was not enough
Dopps and Budo with that final touch
Competition, go and line 'em up
I run this shit, I run this shit, put that on my momma
I done this shit, I done this shit, since I was pushin' a Honda
No one hit shit, no one hit shit, platinum plaques in mi casa
And my accountant's dead 
Couldn't count the commas
I am not surprised, I am not surprised, yeah
Had to optimize, then monopolize, yeah
We turn out the lights, then we come alive, yeah
All these dollar signs, ain't no 9 to 5, yeah
I am not surprised, I am not surprised, yeah
Had to optimize, then monopolize, yeah
We turn out the lights, then we come alive, yeah
All these dollar signs, ain't no 9 to 5, yeah
Gemini
We got that bad love, but it taste like medicine
I never had love, so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought I'd have to choose
Between paradise and you
I still creep on your 'Gram, oh
See you with you and your man, oh
And I scroll, and see the pictures you deleted
Like the history ain't happened, long as we cannot see it
Getting back is insanity, and we repeat it
Momma said we need counseling
But I can't reason with a terrorist
Oh, this is embarrassing
You ain't Cinderella, ain't no pumpkin turning into fuckin' carriages
You create a narrative, people ask me "Where's she been?"
Send her packing, now she's living back out at her parents' crib
Fight, break up, we fuck, we fight, break up, you know the deal
Vent to friends and tell them, "This the last time, I'm for real"
You text me, then the next thing you know, I'm behind the wheel
Pull up, fuck you in the backseat thinking this will help us heal
There's no use for you texting my phone
Got FOMO the minute I walked out the door
Can't get in the gate because I changed the code
Now you can toast to the love we don't make anymore
We got that bad love, but it taste like medicine
I never had love, so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought I'd have to choose
Between paradise and you
And now I'm free 
I'm free, yeah 
I'm free, yeah 
Now I'm free, yeah 
Back on the "Why didn't you text me?"
Back on the "Shit, I was busy"
Back to us raising our voices
Back on that nobody's listening
Back to those horrible choices
Back on you moving back home
'Cause I would rather live in Hell than get comfortable sleeping alone
Back to that lying deception, back to the self-will
Back on that "Well, she don't do it, and I know that somebody else will"
You cheated, I cheated, you cheated, I cheated, I mean it, please Father, forgive us
The dirt that you've done and the secrets that we swept up under the rug that are gonna die with us
And I tried to cut the ties so many times
That I finally gave up on the scissors
We are both sinners, if we both lie to ourselves
That is just selfish, that isn't commitment
I try to hold it and I try to hold it and
Numb to it all and ignoring it
I'm just searching where the closure is
Going in circles, not noticing
But in my heart, I know I'm not over it
We got that bad love, but it taste like medicine
I never had love, so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought I'd have to choose
Between paradise and you
And now I'm free 
I'm free, yeah 
I'm free, yeah 
Now I'm free, yeah 
I know you're troubled, girl
I seen you on Tumblr
February, dressing like a summer girl
Mini skirt on, no underwear 
I wanna take you shopping
Blow a bag of Prada
She say "Those clothes expensive"
So we end up at Zara
Late night, hit the city
And we go out to Target
Like why we go to Target?
This electric wheelchair's poppin'
You read bell hooks and Cornell West
You make me quesadillas when I'm stressed
And be like, "Boy, you better clean up the mess
And take out the trash before you come back"
Stay in, amen, don't fall asleep 'til the AM
Wake up in the morning and I'm prayin'
Sunlight made its way in, gave me angels
And I hold 'em, paint a mural so golden 
And my girl, she sweet as hell
But we'll have a world star moment
Like "I'll fuck this bitch up" 
Yes you will, my darling 
Type of girl fight for the family 
And jump in if there's a problem 
But not today, the ocean waves
I can't complain, I hold her waist
My only ace until we're old and gray
See, that's my baby
Wave after wave, yeah, we're catching the vibe, yeah
Feeling alive, yeah
Ten out of ten, I know you down to ride, yeah
Always by my side, yeah
My baby, know I know
Had to hold you down for sure
You the only one, you the only one, yeah
You the only one, you the only one in my life
You the only one, you the only one, yeah
You the only one, you the only one in my life
And if you feel some type of way, then just say that 
I'm on my way to make it back, talking ASAP 
And we can do all types of things in this Maybach 
Kick off your shoes, relax your feet, while I play that 
That 90's R&B 
Yeah, House Party 3 
Come spend the night with me 
And bring your toiletries
You got your girls with you
I brought my boys with me
Playing that Shai Adina Howard, and that Jodeci 
Do you want a back rub, do you want a massage?
On my birthday, it's my birthday
Do you think we can menage? Sike
El Dorado inside, all suede
Let's go half on some offspring
Girl you flyer than an osprey
We ain't doing a damn thing all day
Wave after wave, yeah, we're catching the vibe, yeah
Feeling alive, yeah
Ten out of ten, I know you down to ride, yeah
Always by my side, yeah
My baby, know I know
Had to hold you down for sure
You the only one, you the only one, yeah
You the only one, you the only one in my life
You the only one, you the only one, yeah
You the only one, you the only one in my life
Corner store, 2 A.M
Got some mango high-chews, a bag of chips
Rollin' through the city and we hide behind the tints
In the Benzo, got the Swisher out the window, then we dip

Okay, 2 A.M. I'm posted 
Dope all in my Jansport
Moving, the youth I run with
Might treat your block like a dance floor
Finesse the rent out the landlord
Momma said "Pull your pants up"
Bending corners and scraper are loyal to tell my bands up
I'm pushin', movin' work, improvin'
There's commas on the way
Put the pussy on pedestal
Blow the medical to the face
It's evident on my face
Rollin' heaven in my new Wraith
Declinin' the call from labels
Still grubbin' on struggle plates
They all wanna know whats next, shit, I don't even know myself
Nah, I don't wanna hear your best shit, I don't really need your help
I'm posted and smokin' just like my uncles before me
I politic with the stagnant, forget my day by the morning, it go

I grew up on Old English, that's that malt liquor 
Never smoked a backwood, it was all Swishers 
Before I pulled a fake ID out on a bartender
I was on a bag of cubensis, walkin' off kilter 
We ain't have no common sense
Do that dirt and hop that fence 
Roastin', talkin' shit, we mobbin', I just got my momma's whip 
We blow dank out that window, right with your tape up, it's garbage
I used to roll up a spliff, and I mixed the weed with the Parliament, ayy 
Couldn't tell you 'bout our future 
We was on the corner, posted 
Wasn't thinking 'bout tomorrow 
On the rooftop smokin' 
Swisher guts in the Funyun bag 
I was just doing my thing 
Hit the hot food aisle 
Got the gizzards instead of the wings 
But it's all love, run my route, play the course
Sweatpants, shorts, wife beater, posted on the porch
Reminiscing, 2:11, and we smokin' on some Ports
And getting hella faded
Gotta re-up so you know we 'bout to hit the—

Takin' my time, workin' it out
Countin' the coin, breakin' my back
All in my loins, all on my nerves
Can't get a break, but that's my snack
Call me Almond Joy, momma's boy
Can't afford none of what you order
Shit, I'm hardly on, not quite broke
Off the wall, but on the border
Pushin' pen to the paper for peso
They wanna Lego
Close construction, no room for the huevos
You gotta love it
That's Benny, he like Montego, he save you like the gecko
He not gon' pay to date you, you get ousted, OG Maco
Boy so wonderful
Them cheap thrills, they come and they go, yeah
Talking 'bout we saved you a seat, boy, boy
They don't want no one to know, long as you comfortable, yeah

That's all 
God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference
My troubles test me on the daily
They say that only God can save me
I think I'm slowly goin' under
But I won't ever tell my brother
And now I wonder where's the good gone?
'Cause I can't find no miracles 'til I go home
Oh, I wonder where's the good gone?
Need to find me some hope
Where's my miracle? Where's my miracle?
Where's my miracle?
It's been a long night
I just might wake up on the wrong side
I tell myself it'll be alright
Sunlight peakin' through the dark sky
Bottle it up, fall in the cut, all out of luck
Drownin' in this quicksand and I'm swallowin' mud
I taste temptation and I fall in and out of love
Grab her hand, taxi cab, in God we trust
You can wish on all the stars, way up in the galaxy
They want you to fall apart, so they can have a piece
I threw a hundred in a wishing well
Ad then I came back for a refund
Said "all this pressure just might tip the scale"
Seen it before, it's just a re-run
So keep runnin', ay, I keep runnin'
My troubles test me on the daily
They say that only God can save me
I think I'm slowly goin' under
But I won't ever tell my brother
And now I wonder where's the good gone?
'Cause I can't find no miracles 'til I go home
Oh, I wonder where's the good gone?
Need to find me some hope
Where's my miracle? Where's my miracle?
Where's my miracle?
I got some secrets, I got some secrets
My palms together, prayin', but I keep on thinkin' 'bout evil
Snake-bit in blood, and the poison, it ain't leaving
Wanna sabotage everything, one and only enemy
If these walls could talk, they'd have a lot of blackmail
Is karma real or not? I can't tell
The Devil complimented me and said "You dance well"
The praise won't save me, and neither will the fan mail
I'd be a sinner, but thank God I'm not religious
And I'm addicted, drugs and women, there's no difference
I know the right, but the wrong is just so tempting
I've got a phobia, fear of what I'm missing, amen
Moms and pops, they used to take us to church
Saying "If you don't believe, then the prayin' don't work"
With the beatbox I got free on the pavement, I'm first
Music brought me to my knees, I found faith in a verse
So dear Spirit, I know I gotta take a chance
And my mistakes and shortcomings finally made a man
I got some issues, I got problems, gotta make amends
I watch my daughter giggin' in the kitchen to the safety dance
This shit right here, we call love
You can't put that into words, but feel that in your gut
The goosebumps on my arms, I watch the fallin' sun
Kiss my daughter and say "Thank God" as I wake up
Oh I know, yeah, I know now
And I'm up, but I'm aware that it goes down
Travelled 'round the globe, I needed to slow down
And no better feeling riding 'round in my hometown
Hope I'm feeling this good when it's Monday mornin'
Been doing my own thing, can't say that I'm sorry
And I can only pray someday that we'll all be
More than just okay, we can be so free
And I can get fly with ya, ride with ya, shine with ya, yeah
I can get fly with ya, ride with ya, shine with ya, yeah
Oh my God, oh my God
No other person on this earth could ever take my job
This my life, it was planned, I can't take it off
Bruised elbows, knees scraped, I learned to take a fall
My mistake, my mistake
Karma waits, karma waits
But I'll be brave, I'll be brave
The pain seems more than I could take, I could take
I learn more from loss than the gain, than the gain
New state of mind, I feel like taking my time
And that laidback reclines, still pushing that '85 Lac
Windows down, city passing by, like a timelapse
The weatherman be trippin', so that ceiling got that white rag, ay
We came so far, just some kids in the city tryna make some art
Leave some change in the fountain, hope to make my mark
You see I was given a role, never played my part
Hope I'm feeling this good when it's Monday mornin'
Been doing my own thing, can't say that I'm sorry
And I can only pray someday that we'll all be
More than just okay, we can be so free
And I can get fly with ya, ride with ya, shine with ya, yeah
I can get fly with ya, ride with ya, shine with ya, yeah
I can have a life to– I have life today. I rely on that constant communication with my higher power, more so than anybody these days. And I realized, that's kinda all I need. And then, of course, y'all appear, right, y'all appear, things appear, and situations appear. And I realize, that's God working through me, if I allow myself to be that vessel.
Fill my lungs up, pour my heart out, peel my bones away
Crack my window, shed my shadow, excavate my pain
If I could read the world my notebook and these thoughts in it
Would they judge me or love me for what I've written?
Tryna get closer to spirit that enters the body
It's the vessel like I'm not in it
In fifty-something years, I won't be here
There'll be a kid with some headphones coverin' his ears
Walkin' 'round a hallway, dreamin' of ideas
Find himself in the sound 'cause music is a mirror
What you looking for? What you headed towards?
What's your name worth when they mention yours?
When you leave here, are you stepping forward?
Can you remember your intention when they question yours?
They're gonna question yours, they're gonna question yours
I've been to rock bottom and I'm headed North
If you don't love yourself, what's the respect for?
If you don't love life, the check won't correct yours
Excavate
Fill my lungs up, pour my heart out, peel my bones away
Crack my window, shed my shadow, excavate my pain
And I found peace
And I found peace
And I found peace
I had this vision of my death
Surrounded by people I love and respect
In the baby blue Cadillac hearse
Pullin' me 'round the block that I rep
The greatest fear that I've ever kept
Is dying with regrets
Like was I just alive for success?
Or did I leave a better life for the rest?
My greatest achievement isn't the dollars
My greatest achievement isn't the followers
My greatest achievement isn't the accolades
My greatest achievement is my daughter
Wakin' up in the morning, bein' a father
Watchin' the light kiss her eyelids
Hearin' her sing along to Chance
And bein' like, "Yeah, that's my kid"
The light started to glow
And the saxophone from Coltrane started to blow
Tender, laying in the snow, turn on my headphones
Couple miles to go before I run out of road
Excavate
Fill my lungs up, pour my heart out, peel my bones away
Crack my window, shed my shadow, excavate my pain
And I found peace
And I found peace
And I found peace
Hold me up into the light and study every part of me
I'm an open book, no, I don't mind, but sometimes I'm hard to read
Just flesh and bone, I'm headed home, but this life is so hard to leave
But who am I when they cut the lights and nobody's watching me?
Hold me up into the light and study every part of me
I'm an open book, no, I don't mind, but sometimes I'm hard to read
Just flesh and bone, I'm headed home, but this life is so hard to leave
But who am I when they cut the lights and nobody's watching me?

Kill Jay Z, they'll never love you
You'll never be enough, let's just keep it real, Jay Z
Fuck Jay Z, I mean, you shot your own brother
How can we know if we can trust Jay Z?
And you know better, nigga, I know you do
But you gotta do better, boy, you owe it to Blue
You had no father, you had the armor
But you got a daughter, gotta get softer
Die Jay Z, this ain't back in the days
You don't need an alibi, Jay Z
Cry Jay Z, we know the pain is real
But you can't heal what you never reveal
What's up, Jay Z? You know you owe the truth
To all the youth that fell in love with Jay Z
You got people you love you sold drugs to
You got high on the life, that shit drugged you
You walkin' around like you invincible
You dropped outta school, you lost your principles
I know people backstab you, I felt bad too
But this 'fuck everybody' attitude ain't natural
But you ain't a saint, this ain't kumbaye
But you got hurt because you did cool by 'Ye
You gave him 20 million without blinkin'
He gave you 20 minutes on stage, fuck was he thinkin'?
"Fuck wrong with everybody?" is what you sayin'
But if everybody's crazy, you're the one that's insane
Crazy how life works
You got a knot in your chest, imagine how a knife hurts
You stabbed Un over some records
Your excuse was "He was talkin' too reckless!"
Let go your ego over your right shoulder
Your left is sayin', "Finish your breakfast!"
You egged Solange on
Knowin' all along, all you had to say you was wrong
You almost went Eric Benét
Let the baddest girl in the world get away
I don't even know what else to say
Nigga, never go Eric Benét!
I don't even know what you woulda done
In the future other niggas playin' football with your son
You woulda lost it
Thirteen bottles of Ace of Spade, what it did to Boston
Nah, Jay Z
Bye, Jay Z

I'ma play the corners where the hustlers be
I told him, "Please don't die over the neighborhood
That your mama rentin'
Take your drug money and buy the neighborhood
That's how you rinse it"
I bought every V12 engine
Wish I could take it back to the beginnin'
I coulda bought a place in Dumbo before it was Dumbo
For like 2 million
That same building today is worth 25 million
Guess how I'm feelin'? Dumbo

You wanna know what's more important than throwin' away money at a strip club? Credit
You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America? This how they did it
Financial freedom my only hope
Fuck livin' rich and dyin' broke
I bought some artwork for one million
Two years later, that shit worth two million
Few years later, that shit worth eight million
I can't wait to give this shit to my children
Y'all think it's bougie, I'm like, it's fine
But I'm tryin' to give you a million dollars worth of game for $9.99
I turned that 2 to a 4, 4 to an 8
I turned my life into a nice first week release date

Good morn' or evening, friends
Smile, you recordin'?
Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors
20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures
We drinkin' Cristal and… yeah
Kept the tray on me like Chris Paul then
Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now
Tryna put a million on the whole team now
Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies, see a sacrifice
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake
Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends
Smile
Here's your friendly announcer

Far as draft picks, my name did not get called
Bet before I go I put a billion on the board
Hall of Fame Hov, I did it all without a pen
Y'all knew that was comin', I had to remind y'all again, huh?
Flyin' paper planes through the projects
Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row
In every one of y'all televised shows
Super facts
Niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that
A loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson
Appreciate the pain, it’s a blessin'
Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends
I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin'
A nigga up in the hundreds of millions
I have no ceilings, ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's "You Bring Me Joy"
Slappin' out of the toy, the separation is clear
In my rear-view mirror, objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair
Playin' for high stakes
Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
In charge of my own fate
Respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours
Niggas own their own houses
Ours was, "Fuck you, pay me"
Now it's, "Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue"
That blood money, I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss's habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Paris
All y'all jewelers should be embarrassed, huh
Blood diamonds drippin' with guilt
I still ain't trippin', that's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, "Prehaps I Freudian slipped in European whips"
God sent me to break the chain
I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do?
'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs
Heroin flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian
Don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed?
I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Fear for you, bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga's freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado
Yeah, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter, smile
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed
Smile
Ready for it
I'm ready for it
Yeah, ahh
Eastside nigga with the feets high
Nigga with that Lisa, uh
Talkin' about that Lisa, nigga, with that Westside, nigga
With that Eastside, that dance, uh
Your eyes speak the truth when everything else lies
May pretend that we kin but the vibes don't fly
Bruh, I survived readin' guys like you
I'm surprised y'all think you can disguise y'all truths
I seen eyes wide as they're about to shoot
You can be a hairpin off and you can trigger your roots
I wave to these haters, don't give me dap
You know the world can see just how phony you act, bruh
Y'all body language is all remedial
How could you see the difference between you and I?
My crash course was much tougher
'Round friends who kill they friends
Then hug their friends' mothers
And show up at the funeral, complete with blank stares
Invisible ink, I had to read things that wasn't there
Memories may sneak down my cheek
But I could see a side-eye in my sleep
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Eyes open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
I'm ready for earth, ready for real
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there
So it seems, so you seem
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare
In my dreams, in my dreams
I sat down with Prince, eye to eye
He told me his wishes before he died
Now, Londell Mc
Millan, he must be color blind
They only see green from them purple eyes
They eyes hide, they eyes high
My eyes wide shut to all the lies
These industry niggas, they always been fishy
But ain't no Biggie, no lazy eye, huh
This guy had 'Slave' on his face
You think he wanted the masters with his masters?
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through his house
I'm surprised you ain't auction off the casket
Don't big bro me, don't "Big Homie"
I've seen pure admiration become rivals
I've been to Paris at least two times
I've seen the Eiffel, I've seen a eyeful
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Eyes open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
I'm ready for earth, ready for real
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there
So it seems, so you seem
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare
In my dreams, in my dreams
I've been out of touch for a couple years
I've been ready for this for real
Hopin' I can touch what I see
'Cause I've been ready for you, for real
Look, you've done enough
Have you no sense of decency, sir?
At long last, have you left no sense of decency?
Eastside nigga with the feets high
Nigga with that Lisa, uh
Talkin' about that Lisa, nigga, with that Westside, nigga
With that Eastside, uh
Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?
Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
"Please come back to Rome," you make it home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
“Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!”
I said: “Don't embarrass me,” instead of “Be mine”
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn this death and
I apologize for all the stillborns cause I wasn't present
Your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
'Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh
I apologize, our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over, what if you over my shit?
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh
And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
"You did what with who?"
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
"You risked that for Blue?"
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away
And Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
My nigga got on
My nigga got on all white, no socks
My nigga got that cocaina on today
That's how he feel, turn my vocal up 
That's how you feel, Emory? 
Turn my vocal up some more
Turn my vocal up, Guru! 
Turn the music up too 
Super Bowl goals
My wife in the crib feedin' the kids liquid gold
We in a whole different mode
Kid that used to pitch bricks can't be pigeonholed
I cooked up more chicken when the kitchen closed
Uh, we gon' reach a billi' first
I told my wife the spiritual shit really work
Alhamdulillah, I run through 'em all
Hovi's home, all these phonies come to a halt
All this old talk left me confused
You'd rather be old rich me or new you?
And old niggas, y'all stop actin' brand new
Like 2Pac ain't have a nose ring too, huh
Nobody wins when the family feuds
But my stash can't fit into Steve Harvey's suit
I'm clear why I'm here, how about you?
Ain't no such thing as an ugly billionaire, I'm cute
 Pretty much
If anybody gettin' handsome checks, it should be us
Fuck rap, crack cocaine
Nah, we did that, Black-owned things
Hundred percent, Black-owned champagne
And we merrily merrily eatin' off these streams
Y'all still drinkin' Perrier-Jouët, hah
But we ain't get through to you yet, uh
What's better than one billionaire? Two 
'Specially if they're from the same hue as you
Y'all stop me when I stop tellin' the truth
Hahahaha 
I would say I'm the realest nigga rappin' 
But that ain't even a statement 
That's like sayin' I'm the tallest midget 
Wait, that ain't politically correct , forget it 
Can I get "Amen" from the congregation?
Amen, amen 
Can I get a "Amen" from the congregation?
Amen, amen 
Ha-ya-ya-ya
Yeah, I'll fuck up a good thing if you let me
Let me alone, Becky
A man that don't take care his family can't be rich
I'll watch Godfather, I miss that whole shit
My consciousness was Michael's common sense
I missed the karma that came as a consequence
Niggas bustin' off through the curtains 'cause she hurtin'
Kay losin' the babies 'cause their future's uncertain
Nobody wins when the family feuds
We all screwed 'cause we never had the tools
I'm tryna fix you
I'm tryna get these niggas with no stripes to be official
Y'all think small, I think Biggie
Y'all whole pass is in danger, ten Mississippi
Al Sharpton in the mirror takin' selfies
How is him or Pill Cosby s'posed to help me?
Old niggas never accepted me
New niggas is the reason I stopped drinkin' Dos Equis
We all lose when the family feuds
What's better than one billionaire? Two
Hahahah
I'll be damned if I drink some Belvedere while Puff got CÎROC
Y'all need to stop
Ha-ya, ha-ya, ha-ya, ha-ya
Ha-ya, ha-ya, ha-ya
Ha-ya-ya-ya
Ha-ya, ha-ya
Love me like, love
Yeah yeah yeah
Like.... yeah, yeah, yeah
Like.... yeah, yeah, yeah
Like.... yeah, yeah, yeah

She don't got time to choose
We stuck in La La Land

Bathing Ape maybe not a gorilla, huh?
Glorified seat filler, huh?
Stop walkin' around like y'all made Thriller, huh?
Fake Dracos all in the videos
We show 'em, we shoot 'em in my city though
I don't post no threats on the Internet
I just pose a threat, blame Lenny S for that
I don't be on the 'Gram goin' ham
Givin' information to the pork, that's all spam
Please don't talk about guns that you ain't never gon' use
Y'all always tell on y'all self, I'm just so fuckin' confused
Y'all stuck in La La Land
Even when we win, we gon' lose
Y'all got the same fuckin' flows
I don't know who is who
We got the same fuckin' watch
She don't got time to choose
We stuck in La La Land
We got the same fuckin' moves
Y'all niggas still signin' deals? Still?
After all they done stole, for real?
After what they done to our Lauryn Hill?
And y'all niggas is 'posed to be trill?
That's real talk when you behind on your taxes
And you pawned all your chains
And they run off with your masters
And took it to Beverly Hills while we in Calabasas
And my head is scratchin'
'Cause that shit is backwards
That shit ain't right
Lucian is cool but Lucian don't write
Doug ain't this tight
So fuck what we sellin', fuck is we makin'?
'Cause their grass is greener
'Cause they always rakin' in mo'
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant
The livest one representin' BK to the fullest
Bastards duckin' when Hov be buckin'
Chicken-heads be cluckin'
Back when ratchet was a ratchet and a vixen was a vixen
And Jam Master Jay was alive I was mixin'
Cookin' coke in the kitchen
Back when Rodman was a Piston
Mike was losin' to Isiah, but he soon would get his sixth one
Gave birth to my verbal imagination
Assume a virtue if you have not
Or better yet here's a verse from Hamlet
"Lord, we know who we are
Yet we know not what we may be"
So maybe I'm the one or maybe I'm crazy
I'm from Marcy Houses, where the boys die by the thousand
Back when Pam was on Martin
Yeah, that's where it all started
When Denzel was blottin' carpet, I'll pack a… nine millimeter
When Slick Rick made "Mona Lisa"
When Lisa Bonet was Beyoncé of her day, I had divas, y'all
Think I just popped up in this bitch like a fetus? Nah
Pregnant pause, give you some second thoughts
There's room on the bandwagon, don't abort
Marcy me
Marcy me
Streets is my artery, the vein of my existence
I'm the Gotham City heartbeat
I started in lobbies, now parley with Saudis
I'm a Sufi to goofies, I could prolly speak Farsi
That's poetry, reek of coca leaf in my past
Came through the bushes smellin' like roses
I need a trophy just for that
Old Brooklyn, not this new shit, shit feel like a spoof
Fat laces in your shoe, I'm talkin' bustin' off the roof
Hold a Uzi vertical, let the thing smoke
Y'all flirtin' with death, I be winkin' through the scope
Shout out to all the murderers turned murals
Plural, fuck the Federal Bureau
Shout out to Nostrand Ave., Flushing Ave., Myrtle
All the County of Kings, may your ground stay fertile
Shout out to Big Poppa, Daddy Kane, heroes
Thus concludin' my concerto
Marcy me
Must be in the air
Oh, can't walk away, I know, I know
Just the way I'm raised
I know, I know, I know
Oh Marcy, Marcy me
Just the way I am always gonna be
I ain't gonna change, no
Marcy, Marcy me, just the way I am
I ain't gonna change, no
I ain't gonna change, no
Couldn't change me if I wanted to
You couldn't change me if you wanted to
I'ma take this with me to the Moon
Daddy, what's a will?
Take those moneys and spread 'cross families
My sisters, Hattie and Lou, the nephews, cousins and TT
Eric, the rest to B for whatever she wants to do
She might start an institute
She might put poor kids through school
My stake in Roc Nation should go to you
Leave a piece for your siblings to give to their children too
TIDAL, the champagne, D'USSÉ, I'd like to see
A nice peace-fund ideas from people who look like we
We gon' start a society within a society
That's major, just like the Negro League
There was a time America wouldn't let us ball
Those times are now back, just now called Afro-tech
Generational wealth, that's the key
My parents ain't have shit, so that shift started with me
My mom took her money, she bought me bonds
That was the sweetest thing of all time, uh
Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy
Black excellence baby, you gon' let 'em see
Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy
Black excellency, baby, let 'em see
I remember, like, listenin' to Wu-Tang
And niggas like, "Your seed married his seed, married my seed"
That's how we keep Carter money all in the family
You see, my father, son of a preacher man
Whose daughter couldn't escape the reach of the preacher's hand
That charge of energy set all the Carters back
It took all these years to get to zero in fact
I hated religion 'cause here was this Christian
He was preachin' on Sundays, versus how he was livin' Monday
Someday I forgive him
'Cause strangely our division led to multiple religions
I studied Muslim, Buddhist, and Christians
And I was runnin' from him, He was givin' me wisdom
See how the universe works?
It takes my hurt and help me find more of myself
It's a gift and a curse
That's called the Red Queen's Race
You run this hard just to stay in place
Keep up the pace, baby
Keep up the pace
You run this hard just to stay in place
Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy
Black excellence, you gon' let 'em see
Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy
Black excellency, baby, let 'em see
Day, someday, someday we'll all
Someday we'll all be free
Uh, letter to my dad that I never wrote
Speeches I prepared that I never spoke
Words on a paper that I never read
Proses never penned, they stayed in my head
Jotted on dotted lines, "I'mma fight you, nigga"
From stories that I heard, I'm just like you, nigga
Must've been some pain in your past, too
Must've been a karma that was past due
Must it be the energy that passed through
Must've been a pastor, many snafus
Started a good man, you married my mama
I was in her belly, you hurried that Summer
She had two kids from a previous mister
One family, I don't believe in half-sisters
Never treated my brother like a step, Pop
Remembered the many lessons when we stepped out
What was you preparing us... for?
Did you see the runt as the front-runner
Leader of the pack, you see that in your youngins
What ancestors did you summon to the summit
To give me what I needed, what you need to take from 'em
The tsunamis that I swum in to become in
Had the cable with the anchor for the places that I sunk in
Unc in a better place but you couldn't function
Shot junk in your arms, more than your veins was punctured
I punted on feelings, 'cause you said you was coming
You couldn't kick the habit, I wish you said something
You can't avenge these many sins with your own hands
You wanna make God laugh, just tell him your plans
Who would've thought I'd be the dad I never had
Be the husband I've become, usually nothing come from that
I forgive you as I live through the beautiful present of the past
I'm just thankful that I get all these gifts to unwrap
What were you preparing us... for?
You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it
I still don’t know why, why our love is so much, ohh
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why, why I love it so much
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screamin' you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
Blue told me remind you niggas
Fuck that shit y'all talking 'bout, I'm the nigga
Caught up in all these lights and cameras
But look what that shit did to Hammer
Goddamn it, I like it
Bright lights is enticin', but look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night, thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice; that's my bad, I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma, please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame; Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself
And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid and contagious
And we all just entertainers
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screamin' you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body, curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water
You still alive, still that nigga
Nigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger
Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive; Michael Jackson's Thriller
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screamin' you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why, why I love you so much, yeah
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve
Forever in ink with guess whose name
But I still don't know why, why our love is so much
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screamin' you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
I just want a Picasso in my casa, no, my castle
I'm a hassa, no, I'm an asshole
I'm never satisfied, can't knock my hustle
I wanna Rothko, no, I want a brothel
No, I want a wife that fuck me like a prostitute
Let's make love on a million
In a dirty hotel with the fan on the ceiling
All for the love of drug dealing
Marble floors, gold ceilings
Oh, what a feeling, fuck it, I want a billion
Jeff Koons balloons, I just wanna blow up
Condos in my condos, I wanna row of
Christie's with my missy, live at the MoMa
Bacons and turkey bacons, smell the aroma
Oh, what a feeling
Picasso baby
Picasso
Picasso baby
Oh, what a feeling
Picasso baby
Picasso
Picasso baby
It ain't hard to tell, I'm the new Jean Michel
Surrounded by Warhols, my whole team ball
Twin Bugattis outside the Art Basel
I just wanna live life colossal
Leonardo Da Vinci flows
Riccardo Tisci Givenchy clothes
See me throning at the Met
Vogueing on these niggas, champagne on my breath, yes
House like the Louvre or the Tate Modern
Cause I be going ape at the auction
Oh what a feeling, aw, fuck it, I want a trillion
Sleeping every night next to Mona Lisa
The modern day version with better features
Yellow Basquiat in my kitchen corner
Go 'head, lean on that shit Blue, you own it
Oh, what a feeling
Picasso baby
Picasso
Picasso baby
Oh, what a feeling
Picasso baby
Picasso
Picasso baby
"The golden number."
"Touché."
I never stuck my cock in the fox's box but
Damned if I ain't open Pandora's box
They try to slander your man on CNN and Fox
My Mirandas don't stand a chance with cops
Even my old fans like, "Old man, just stop"
I could if I would, but I can't, I'm hot
And you blow, I'm still the man to watch
Hublot on my left hand or not
Soon I step out the booth, the cameras pops
Niggas is cool with it 'til the canons pop
Now my hand on the Bible on the stand
Got your man in a jam again, got my hands in cuff
I'm like goddamn enough
I put down the cans and they ran amok
My hairpin pierce skin, ruptures spleens
Cracks ribs, go through cribs, and other things
No sympathy for the king, huh?
Niggas even talk about your baby crazy
Eventually the pendulum swings
Don't forget America this how you made me
Come through with the 'Ye mask on
Spray everything like SAMO, I won't scratch the Lambo
What's it gon take for me to go
For you to see, I'm the modern day Pablo, Picasso baby
Clap for a nigga with his rapping ass
Blow a stack for your niggas with your trapping ass
Tom Ford
Coming up, coming down
Riding clean fix your hair in my Crown
Bad bitch, H town
Keep it trill, y'all know y'all can't fuck around
Paris where we been, pard' my Parisian
It's Hov time in no time, it's fuck-all-y'all season
Piss Bordeaux and Burgundies, flush out a Riesling
When Hov's out, them hoes out, y'all put y'all weaves in, and
Clap for a nigga with his rapping ass
Blow a stack for your niggas with your trapping ass
Spent all my euros on tuxes and weird clothes
I party with weirdos, yeah Hov, yeah Hov
I don't pop molly, I rock Tom Ford
International bring back the Concorde
Numbers don't lie, check the scoreboard
Tom Ford
Hands down got the best flow, sound I'm so special
Sound boy burial, this my Wayne Perry flow
Y'all know nothing 'bout Wayne Perry though
District of Columbia, guns on y'all Tumblrs
Fuck hashtags and retweets, nigga

Pardon my laughing, y'all only flagging on beats, nigga
Pardon my laughing, I happen to think you sweet

Cent'anni, ciao bella
Come money dance with the good fellas
Hov keep gettin' that dinero, got it
Even if a nigga gotta rob it, get it?
Black Jack in a casino
A nigga got unlimited credit
A nigga got a lot of vendettas
But we the Black mob, we gonna set it
Peel off in a Lamborghini Countach
200 in the dash, we gonna rev it 
Lucky Luciano is what they call me, paesano
A 100 keys at the piano
Plays across the Verrazano
El Padrino, in the villa in Venice, sippin' vino
Not bad for a mulignan
Y'all know like we know, I got it
Fuck with me, you know I got it

Got a bad bitch, she a master; peace
Blessings, blessings, yeah, I see..
Elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady, docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo before the Basquiat show
And if so, well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family, this water mixed my blood
This water tells my story, this water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean
Dope boy still smelling like cocaina
White boat, white robe, can he be more cleaner?
The oil spill that BP ain't clean up
I'm anti-Santa Maria
Only Christopher we acknowledge is Wallace
I don't even like Washingtons in my pocket
Black card go hard when I'm shopping
Boat dock in front of Hermes picking cotton
Silk and fleeces, lay on my Jesus
Oh my God, I hope y'all don't get seasick
See me in shit you never saw
If it wasn't for these pictures they wouldn't see me at all
Aww, whole world's in awe
I crash through glass ceilings, I break through closed doors
I'm on the ocean, I'm in heaven
Yachting, Ocean 11
Elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady, docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo before the Basquiat show
And if so, well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family, this water mixed my blood
This water tells my story, this water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean
Me and Ty Ty is like Pablo and Popeye
Winding dirt roads on mopeds spilling Opus
Welcome to the magnum opus, the Magna Carta
The best-selling author Decoded
On the holiday playin' "Strange Fruit"
If I'ma make it to a billi I can't take the same route
Swoosh, that's the sound of the border
Swoosh, and that's the sound of a baller
Muhammad Hovi my back against the rope
The black Maybach, I'm back inside the boat
Shepard Fairey they finally gave me some hope
Can't believe they got a nigga to vote
Democrat? Nope, I sold dope
In trouble waters I had to learn how to float
On the ocean, I'm in heaven
Yachting, Ocean 11
Elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady, docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo before the Basquiat show
And if so, well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family, this water mixed my blood
This water tells my story, this water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean
Just let me be great, let me be great
I feel like mothafuckin' Cassius Clay right now, Genius!
Don't be good my nigga, be great
After that government cheese, we eating steak
After the projects, now we on estates
I'm from the bottom, I know you can relate
Fuck up the world
Just fuck up this world
Fuck up the world
Me and destiny got a date
Martin had a dream, Hov got a team
My chain already heavy, don't let me get a ring
Parades down Flatbush, Confetti on my fur
Turn right in Red Hook, niggas heavy on the curb
See most my niggas died early twenties or late teens
I'm just trying to come from under the thumb of this regime
1% of a billion more than niggas even seen
Still they wanna act like it's an everyday thing, clean
Fuck up this world
Fuck up the, uhh
High Yellow sky dweller and the rose gold
Legend of the summer in the Rose Bowl
Came through Pasadena in the low-low
Just to show respect to the cholos
Feelin' like a stranger in my own land
Got me feeling like Brody in Homeland
I just want a shot to show my genius
Standing on the top hold my penis
America tried to emasculate the greats
Murder Malcolm, gave Cassius the shakes
Wait, tell them rumble young man rumble
Try to dim your lights tell you be humble
You know I'm gon' shine like a trillion watts
You know a nigga trill as Michael Jackson socks
Sendin' light out to Compton and the hundred blocks
Lil bastard boy, basking on top
I fuck up this world
Just fuck up this world
Let's fuck up the world
Fuck up the, uhh
Sipping D'USSE boy this ain't your daddy yak
He in a Cadillac; me? I'm in the Maybach
This ain't grey sweat suits and white tube socks
This is black leather pants and a pair of Stance
Socks is my synopsis is clear
Got stripclubs feeling like Oxford, I swear
Teacher-teacher, I'm trying to unteach ya
All the shit they taught y'all, they got you all in the bleachers
When you front row at the Knicks game, those the Spike Lees
You front row everywhere, you in the H.O.V.'s
Jordan 1's and dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Make a million another million let my niggas make a million
'til we all check a billion, shit it's just the way I'm feeling
We have yet to see a ceiling, we just top what we top
Cause the bars don't struggle and the struggle don't stop
Just fuck up this world
Shout out to old Jews and old rules
New blacks with new stacks
I already been the king
Retro act, I'm just bringing it back like Jordan Packs
New money, they looking down on me
Blue bloods they trying to clown on me
You can turn up your nose high society
Never gone turn down the homie
Knock knock I'm at your neighbor house
Straight cash I bought ya neighbor out
You should come to the housewarming
Come and see what your new neighbor 'bout 
Yellow Lambo in the driveway
A buck thirty-five, I'm on the highway
Frank Sinatra on my Sonos
Loud as fuck, I did it my way
A million sold before the album dropped
White Lexus before I had a deal
Ask Bun B about me
This ain't no snap back, a nigga been trill
By the way, fuck your mag
You ain't gotta count it my nigga I can add
1 million, 2 million, 3 million, 20 million
Oh, I'm so good at math
Might crash ya Internet
And I ain't even into that
When I was talking Instagram
Last thing you wanted was your picture snapped
Feds still lurking
They see I'm still putting work in
Cause somewhere in America
Miley Cyrus is still twerkin'
Twerk, twerk 
Only in America
They can't keep a good man down
Always keep a smile when they want me to frowns
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
They will never ever take my crown
Who Jah bless I say no man curse
Things gettin' better when they thought it would be worse
Here comes the officers askin' for a search
They found no weapon just only a draw of herbs
You in the presence of a king
Scratch that, you in the presence of a God
Put in the belly of the beast
I escaped, a nigga never had a job
Scott Boras, you over baby
Robinson Cano, you coming with me
These niggas like rotary phones
It's a new day, hit up KD
Niggas always try to knock a nigga down
Knock me to my knees about a million times
Uncle said I'll never sell a million records
I sold a million records like a million times
These niggas shouldn't let me in
I ball so hard on ESPN
See my name come across on CNN
'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see it again
'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see me again
Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of your history
Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of they history
If Fear is your only God
Get y'all to fear me is my only job
Crown, crown
Crown, crown
Bulletproof glass, glass roof like the Pope
Bulletproof love, niggas down since the yolk
Bitch asked if I was God, fuck I'm supposed to say no?
You already seen me turn a man to a G.O.A.T
You already know what I could do with the coke
Dropped it in the water, made it disappear
I made it reappear, I had that bitch on a rope
I make my roof get ghost, bottom grill, I make my tooth get gold
All the shit I did, I wasn't supposed to live, Hallelujah Hov
Wasn't for the 'caine wouldn't be able
Wasn't for the bread, probably be dead
Best friends become ya enemies, niggas' knives are double-edged
Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of your history
Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of they history
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head – this is God body
Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding, we just want our equality
Food, clothing, shelter, help a nigga find some peace
Happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in these streets
Conspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati
They can't believe this much skill is in the human body
He's 6'2", how the fuck he fit in a new Bugatti?
Aw, fuck it, you got me
Question religion, question it all
Question existence until them questions are solved
Meanwhile this heretic, I be out in Marrakesh
Morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship
Y'all dwell on devil shit, I'm in a Diablo
Yellow shit, color of Jell-O shit
Hello bitch, it's me again
Fresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and
That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion, losing my religion
Getting ghost in the Ghost, can you see me? Can you see me?
Have mercy on a Judas, angel wings on a 'ghini
I'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down
Y'all religion creates division like my Maybach partition
And God is my chauffeur, boy they love Hova
From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up
I confess, God in the flesh
Live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches
I'm like Michael, recycle, these are not 16's
These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a motherfuckin' prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
You gotta love it, I arrive at the pearly gates
I had luggage, meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh
Heaven or Hell, the cards we been dealt
Are the cards that we play, play, play
Die for what you believe, only one god recedes
When the shots spray, spray, spray
